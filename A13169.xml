            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Small, I ſay, in reſpect of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (for what ſhould I need to labour in anſwering ſo friuolous &amp; triuial matters) and not great in reſpect of the volume, for that fewe wordes might ſerue to cleare all doubtes, that ſtand vpon our aduerſaries bare wordes. Yet I hope, it ſhall not bee eſteemed either vntimely or vnprofitable, if we regard the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For it conteineth a neceſſary defence of our Chriſtian faith, and of the profeſſors thereof againſt the wicked calumniations of a rayling Maſſe-prieſt called <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> and a ſober anſwere to his virulent, and per caſe vinolent inuectiues, by him entitled <hi>a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of the new Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſons that mooued mee to direct this diſcourſe to your Lordſhip are diuers. Firſt your deepe iudgement and skill in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature. Next your piety and zeale for the cauſe of Religion. Thirdly your place in this Chriſtian Common-wealth. And laſtly thoſe honorable fauors, which it hath pleaſed your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to ſhew to me in particuler, and to Gods Miniſters in generall. For if the ſame were approoued by a man of ſuch authority and
<pb facs="tcp:177778:3"/> iudgement, I doubted not, but it would receiue grace the rather in the common eſtimation of others. And being publiſhed in defence of piety and Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I preſumed it would receiue good intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the handes of euery man ſtudious of truth and piety. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore if any falſe companion ſhould take vppon him, either to giue out falſe particulers of his Maieſties landes, or to make a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of them without warrant, or iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it belongeth to your place in this ſtate, to reuew and controll his indiſcretion, and to puniſh his preſumption. Much more therefore behooueth it you, conſidering your functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; eminent place in this Chriſtian ſtate, to concurre with vs in cenſuring this madde Surueyor of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; controlling his indiſcreete &amp; ranging diſcourſe hauing in ſo many particulers wronged the King of Kinges, and his eternall truth.</p>
            <p>What the end was of this his Suruey we may eaſily coniecture. As the Prieſtes, Scribes, and Phariſyes by rayling againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles ſought to drawe the peoples affection from them, and to allure them to like their errors; ſo this Prieſt of <hi>Baal</hi> by his ſlaundrous imputations laid vpon Chriſtian Religion, and the profeſſors thereof ſeeketh to diſturne me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the loue of truth, and to draw them to Popiſh errors. It may be alſo, that ſeeking to defame others, he thought to qualify the enormities of his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſortes, and their wicked Hereſyes. The <hi>Donatiſtes,</hi> as <hi>Optatus</hi> in lib. <hi>1.</hi> aduerſ. <hi>Parmen.</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>went about to defame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens liues, that they might cauſe their owne faultes to be paſſed in ſilence.</hi> Vt crimina in ſilentium mitterent ſua, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam infamare conati ſunt alienam.</p>
            <p>What ſubſtance is in this worthleſſe worke it appeareth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his tedious preambles, idle diſcourſes, falſe collections, weake concluſions, forged allegations, &amp; his other fooleryes too common in euery Chapter. The whole volume of his ſycophanticall <hi>Suruey</hi> is nothing elſe, but a compoſition of diuers old endes of childiſh declamations, mingled with a decoction of ſtale calumniations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt particuler men many times, and in diuers Bookes reiected
<pb facs="tcp:177778:3"/> by vs, and now againe brought forth by him, therby to empoyſon his credulous folowers, if they happen to taſte ſo vnpleaſant a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Booke he had little reaſon to call a <hi>Suruey of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For therein he neither obſerueth rules of Religion, nor of commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ciuility. It might rather haue beene titled <hi>a ſurfet of a madde Maſſe-prieſtes malice, degorged out of</hi> a corrupt ſtomacke fraught with vndigeſted humors of Popiſh calumniations &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. <hi>Quod deſcriptionis dedecus?</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome Lib. 1. contr. Iouinian.</hi> That is, <hi>what a ſhamefull Suruey is this?</hi> But better may we apply theſe wordes to this Suruey. For it is both ſhamefull, and harmefull, and ſeemeth to ſauor rather of a mad-mans malice, then of a Doctors learning and ſobriety. As <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith of <hi>Photinus haereſ. 71.</hi> Verba maledicentiae neutiquam conſiſtere valentia euomuit. <hi>Hee hath degorged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs many rayling termes, but they haue neither grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor coherence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not inſiſt long to tell your Lordſhip, what manner of man this <hi>Kelliſon</hi> is. Let his Booke and our anſwer ſpeake. He calleth himſelfe a Doctor. But as <hi>Hierome epiſt. 61.</hi> ſpeaking of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Biſhop doubteth whether <hi>ludio an epiſcopus loquitur,</hi> ſo I may doubt of this Doctor, whether hee was an <hi>Italian</hi> mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bancke, or a Doctor of <hi>Doway.</hi> Some ſay it is not long ſince this great Doctor was my <hi>Lord Vauxes</hi> Butler. And the rather I beleeue it, for that he hath ſet vs a broach a Butte of his owne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, lyes, and fooleryes. His friendes ſuppoſe, that as his heart is become Spaniſh, ſo hee hath better grace in drawing of Spaniſh wine then in talking of Religion.</p>
            <p>Little did either the man, or his matter deſerue anſwere. But yet for the inſtruction of the ſimple, and confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the weake, I haue beſtowed ſome labour in examining the particulers of this Suruey.

Thus relying vpon your fauor, I commend this Treatiſe to your Lordſhip, and your Lordſhip to the Almightyes protection, beſeeching him to bleſſe you and yours in this life, and in the life to come to giue you a crowne of glory promiſed to all thoſe that ſhall perſeuer to the end, and manfully and ſeriouſly contend for the maintenance of truth, and the ſetting foorth of Gods Glory.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO <hi>THE READER:</hi> Conteyning a briefe Cenſure vpon the Title and the front of <hi>Kelliſons Suruey,</hi> and his two liminare Epiſtles and Praeambles.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Deuill, as we read <hi>Iob</hi> 1. is ſaid <hi>To compaſſe the Worlde, and to walke through it,</hi> and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth vs, that he is a very buſie &amp; curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Surueyer. We are not therefore to thinke it ſtrange, if his children do immitate their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and proue great compaſſers of the world, and contriuers of plots and ſurueyes, to bring men within the circle of their owne errors. Among the reſt, one <hi>Kelliſon</hi> a cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per kettle Maſſe-preiſt, hath ſhewed him-ſelfe a great compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſer of ſea and land, to winne proſelytes to the Synagogue of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and a buſie and captious ſurueyer to eſpye motes in our Chriſtian faith: &amp; for this end hath ſet out a large volume, called <hi>The Suruey of the new Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But firſt we ſay to him, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid to a man of his qualitie. Hypocrita, primu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eijce trabem &amp;c. <hi>Hipocrite, firſt caſt the beame out of thine owne eye, and then thou ſhalt more eaſily ſee to take a mote out thy brothers eye.</hi> So we pray him to diſcharge his Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the juſt imputation of noueltie, &amp; then he may with more reaſon taxe others for maintayning newe religion. As for our Religion, it is vniuſtly and abſurdly termed newe. For as <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaid in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians, Chriſt is our antiquitie.</hi> And in religion that is moſt ancient, <hi>that is from the
<pb facs="tcp:177778:6"/> Apoſtles,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth ſignifie. If then our Religion be from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and is grounded vpon the holy Scriptures, and not vpon late Decretales, and the opinions of Popes, School-men and Canoniſts: how is the ſame reputed newe? doth not <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon</hi> remember, that the ſomme of our whole deſire is, that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh nouelties, and the late Tridentine doctrine being aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, we may returne to the ancient, Catholike and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith?</p>
            <p>Abſurdly alſo he &amp; his conſorts repute the <hi>Romiſh</hi> moderne religion to be ancient, ſeeing the ſame, as it differeth from the religion profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is nothing but an hochpot of hereſies, and erroneous &amp; corrupt doctrine, either deriued from late School-men, or firſt eſtabliſhed by the late Conuenticles of <hi>Trent, Florence, Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Lateran,</hi> or by little and little confirmed by corrupt cuſtome. The Popiſh Maſſe (as it now ſtandeth) is but a late patcherie. In the olde ordinall of <hi>Rome</hi> it appeareth, that neither priuate Maſſes, nor halfe Communions, nor Tranſubſtantiation, nor the ſacrifice of Chriſts body and blood contayned vnder the accidents of bread and wine, for quicke and dead, nor the adoration of the Sacrament with latria, nor prayers to Saints, and for the dead, were in vſe in ancient time. The Fathers doe no where teach, that brute beaſts receiuing a conſecrated hoaſt, eate Chriſts fleſh, or that Chriſts fleſh is receiued downe into mens bellyes: nay they teach quite contrary. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> for many yeares vſed not the temporall ſworde; Neither was the Pope Lord of <hi>Rome</hi> vntill the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt condemned both the vniuerſall authoritie of one Biſhop ouer the reſt, and the adoration of Images. Neuer was it imagined before the time of the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> that euery pield Maſſe-prieſt, as ofte as he ſaid Maſſe wrought three miracles. The neceſſitie of auricular confeſſion, was firſt decreed by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the third. The number of 7. Sacraments albeit before talked of idly by School-men, was not by any publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie receiued before the Conuenticle of <hi>Florence.</hi> Finally, it is eaſie to ſhew, that the Popes doctrine concerning Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Purgatorie, the worſhip of Saints, and Images, extreame vnction, and other poynts of religion in controuerſie betwixt the Papiſts and vs, is lately brought in, and more newe then
<pb facs="tcp:177778:6"/> that religion which we profeſſe, &amp; which by <hi>Kelliſon</hi> is lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falſely called newe.</p>
            <p>Many wonder alſo, why he ſhould call his Treatiſe <hi>A Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of the newe Religion:</hi> ſeeing the poyntes which he handleth, are neither matters of religion, nor profeſſed by vs, nor proued againſt them, vpon whome they are fathered by <hi>Cochleus, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus, Genebrard, Bolſec, Stapleton, Sanders,</hi> and ſuch like lying paraſites.</p>
            <p>He profeſſeth him-ſelfe a Doctor, but his Diſcourſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him to be in the number of thoſe of whome the Apoſtle ſpeaketh 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>Which would be Doctors of the Law, and yet vnderſtand not whereof they ſpeake, nor whereof they affirme.</hi> If he haue no more knowledge, then he hath ſhewed in this <hi>Suruey,</hi> he is <hi>a Doctor and profeſſor of Diuinitie</hi> of a lowe price. Little certes doth he vnderſtand, what that profeſſion meaneth, that could not diſtinguiſh his owne, &amp; his fellowes calumniations from the grounds and articles of our religion. And euill doth he deſerue the title of a Doctor, &amp; profeſſor of diuinitie, which ſo often ſpeaketh againſt Scriptures: and <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. calleth the proofes grounded vpon them <hi>bare:</hi> and rather deriueth his diuinitie out of the ſinkes of School-men, and corrupt puddles of Philoſophers, then out of holy Scriptures. <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. he calleth the working of Gods ſpirit <hi>a fancy. Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. he blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth not to write, that juſtification by fayth in Chriſt without workes, is a doctrine <hi>opening a gappe to all ſinnes.</hi> Againſt <hi>Chriſts</hi> Prieſthood, this prieſt of <hi>Baal</hi> talketh prophanely, as if the ſame were imperfect without the addition of Romiſh Maſſe-prieſtes. And with <hi>Chriſts</hi> Sacrifice he compareth, nay he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualleth the ſacrifice of the Maſſe. Of Chriſtian libertie he diſcourſeth freely, but very fondly, and falſely denying, that the ſame conſiſteth any whit in the deliuerance of mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from the curſſe of the law, from the yoke of Iewiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes, and humane traditions. Againſt the aſſurance, that Chriſtians haue of Gods fauour, and of their owne ſaluation, he runneth out and reuelleth, as if it were a dangerous poynt of doctrine, and a cauſe of diuers inconueniences: all which doe argue, that he is but a kettle-doctor of diuinitie, and a profeſſor like to thoſe, of whome the Apoſtle ſpeaking <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſayth, <hi>When they profeſſed them-ſelues wiſe, they became fooles.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:177778:7"/>
            <p>In matters in Religion and Diuinitie, he tumbleth him-ſelfe, as the olde Prouerb ſayth, <hi>Tanquam Aſinus in vnguento,</hi> that is, as an Aſſe ſmeared with a coſtly oyntment. For although the profeſſion of diuinitie be honorable; yet it fitteth this Beere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawer or Tapſter, that calleth him-ſelfe a Doctor and profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of Diuinitie, no better, then it fitteth an Aſſe to be perfumed with Muske and Ciuet.</p>
            <p>For his deuiſe he chuſeth theſe two Se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences, <hi>Doe men gather Grapes of thornes, or Figs of thiſtles?</hi> &amp;, <hi>They ſhal proſper no further, For their folly ſhalbe made manifeſt to all.</hi> The firſt being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. &amp; the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out of 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. &amp; both ſeruing vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude againſt him &amp; his conſortes, whoſe diſcourſes are rather like bundles of thornes, &amp; thiſtles, then like Grapes &amp; Figges. It ſeemeth when he framed them, he ſhooke his lippes like an Aſſe cropping of thiſtles. From a man of ſuch a diſtemperd humour we are not to looke for better frutes. And certes no maruel, if ſuch lying and rayling courſes proſper not. <hi>Menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia non diu fallunt</hi> ſayth <hi>Cyprian lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 3. That is, <hi>Lyes doe not long deceiue,</hi> neyther doth darkneſſe continue, when the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to appeare. Now their lying and cogging, &amp; all their fooleryes are daily more and more made manifeſt. <hi>Euripides</hi> in <hi>Andromacha</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> calleth them <hi>Kings of lyes and ſowers of miſchiefe.</hi> And <hi>Athanaſius ad Conſtantium</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Arians: Miror</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>eos ſine vlla abominatione aut hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore mendacij ita falſa &amp;c. potuiſſe dicere. I wonder how without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and abhomination of the fact, they could deuiſe thinges ſo falſe!</hi> But with far better reaſon we may ſay this of <hi>Kelliſon</hi> &amp; other our aduerſaryes, who in lying and aequiuocating, paſſe both <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Africans,</hi> and lay plots of miſchiefe neuer heard of in anye age before. They make no Conſcience what they ſweare. We may not therefore thinke it ſtrange, if he ſpeake any thing ſounding to our diſgrace moſt falſely. As <hi>Tertullian lib. contra Hermog.</hi> ſayth of that heretike, ſo we may ſay of <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſon. Loquacitatem faecundiam exiſtimat &amp;c.</hi> He thinketh <hi>babling to be eloquence, and impudencye to be conſtancye.</hi> And theſe are the frutes and effectes of <hi>Kelliſons</hi> labours.</p>
            <p>It reſteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauing ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Tytle &amp; front of his worke, that wee doe our endeauour to make this mans folly appeare moſt manifeſtly in the reſt of his Suruey, &amp; that wee preſcribe
<pb facs="tcp:177778:7"/> ſome Triacle to ſuch as otherwiſe might percaſe taſte of his poyſoned diſcourſes. But before we paſſe any further, wee are firſt to examine his two praeambular Epiſtles; wherof the firſt is directed to the King, the ſecond to euery other Reader.</p>
            <p>Vnto Kings, men of diſcretion vſe not to preſent trifles, or elſe matters not pleaſing their humours, or not ſorting with their royall Majeſties excellencie, endeuouring as much as in them lyeth, to make their giftes correſpond with their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But <hi>Kelliſon</hi> reſpected all this nothing. For albeit this Suruey be a moſt idle deuiſe, and moſt vnworthy to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo wiſe, learned, pious and famous a King, as conteining nothing elſe but a fardle of lyes, calumniations, and fooleryes, and certaine odde fragments of olde declamations euaporated with age: Yet no inferiour perſon could ſatiſfie him, then our King; ſuch was his arrogancye and impudencie. Nay albeit he plainly perceiued incongruitie, yet could he not forbeare to preaſe into the Kings preſence, and there to offer vp a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his Suruey, a fitter offring for Vulcan, then for any man of note or dignitye.</p>
            <p>He ſuppoſeth, that therein he hath committed only <hi>three inciuilities.</hi> But if he would haue ſpoken plainly, hee ſhould haue named them three groſſe abſurdities, as indeed they are. For firſt, what is, or can be deuiſed more abſurd, then for a bald idolatrous Maſſe-prieſt, to preſume to preſent himſelfe before a religious and Chriſtian King, enimie to all Idolaters, and Prieſts of <hi>Ball?</hi> for a ſworne ſlaue of King-killing Popes, and a teacher and a maintainer of their wicked &amp; diſloyall doctrine, to preſume to appeare before a King, whoſe life, he &amp; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorts haue ſougnt to take away, and whoſe Royall authoritie and Honour, all <hi>Papiſts</hi> doe empaire, and whoſe Crowne all Maſſe-prieſtes ſeeke to deliuer into the Popes hands? For a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiue and an enimie to his Prince &amp; Country, boldly to ſpeak to ſo mightie a King, and ſo kinde a Father to his Country and ſubjects? Secondly, might ſuch an idolatrous Saltpeter-prieſt and a fugitiue Traytor be pardoned for his arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous boldneſſe, daring to come into a Princes preſence, that is ſo hardly preſſed with the great weight &amp; multitude of the affayres of ſtate, as himſelfe confeſſeth? yet modeſtie might haue taught him, if any ſparke of modeſty had been in him, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:177778:8"/> we may not forbeare to tell him, that it is too great rudeneſſe, for fugitiues to thruſt in among the Peeres of the Realme, and for baſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions to appeare without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion among the Ambaſſadours of great Princes, as he hath done. Thirdlie if needs he would preſſe into the Kings preſence, and like a Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-maker ſtand among great men with his preſent, then hee ſhould haue thought vpon ſome thing, that might be more gratefull, then this ſcurrilous Libel, containing nothing but calumniations, inuectiues, and declamations againſt that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which both the King and his people profeſſeth, &amp; ſhall alwayes be juſtified to be moſt true and Apoſtolike, againſt him and all his partakers. At the leaſt, if he had nothing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that might pleaſe ſo great a Prince, yet ſhould he haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne to offer that, which both to him and all true Chriſtians cannot chuſe, but be moſt vngratefull and odious.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe abſurdities, our ſurueyor hath runne into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers groſſe errors. For firſt he compareth the King to an Idole, where he maketh him <hi>like a Neptune Lord of the Ocea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sea.</hi> So he is not only a worſhipper of Idoles, but alſo would gladlie make an Idole of the King. Secondly, in ſetting forth the Kings prayſes, he ſpeaketh contraries, now repreſenting his maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye ſitting <hi>in a Throne of terror:</hi> and not long after calling him <hi>the myldeſt Prince in Europe.</hi> But what is more contrarie, then terror and mildneſſe? and what Sect in ſauage crueltie can be compared to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that of late haue attempted by fire and Gun-powder to deſtroy him, whome they confeſſe to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the myldeſt Prince in Europe? Thirdly, he taketh from the King all authority <hi>in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes,</hi> which he reſerueth to his holy Father, and his dependants: and although in termes he doe not abridge the Kings right in his Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poralities; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one knoweth, that <hi>Papiſts</hi> make Kinges the Popes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and giue to the Pope power to cenſure and depoſe Kings: which none can maintaine, but ſuch as are diſloyall to Princes, and ſlaues to Popes. Fourthly, moſt cunningly he doth inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that Kings and Princes are beholding to Prieſtes for their Kingdomes; becauſe <hi>they receiue of them</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Crownes</hi> and <hi>Scepters.</hi> So this prating Maſſe-prieſt doth not only treacherouſly ſubject Kinges to the Popes ſword and cenſures, but alſo abſurdly tyeth their right and inheritance
<pb facs="tcp:177778:8"/> to the Crowne, to the rite of conſecration. Finally, not content to debaſe the Kings Royall ſtate, and to deminiſh his right, he compareth himſelfe in his Prieſt-hood moſt proudly to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, and his holy Apoſtles. But none but the diſciples of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> make them-ſelues in prieſt-hood comparable to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor doe any but falſe Apoſtles make the Apoſtles ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and aequall themſelues to the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Now theſe errors he acknowledged not, nor can excuſe. His inciuility he would gladly excuſe and defend. But his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is worſe, then the offence it ſelfe. <hi>For the firſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian the Emperour will excuſe me, who commended vnto Minutius his proconſul of Aſia, as a thing of importance: Ne nomen condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur ſed crimen.</hi> He maketh alſo along diſcourſe, relating vnto vs, how wrongfully Chriſtians were hated for the name. But what affinity is there betweene the names of Chriſtians, and the names of ſacrificing Maſſe-prieſts? Againe, how can the cyclopicall prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> pretend to be ſucceſſors eyther of the Apoſtles, or of auncient Biſhops? Did euer any auncient Biſhop or other Doctor of the Church ſay, that the prieſt did ſwallowe downe Chriſtes body whole into his bellie? againe, if that which is offered be conſumed, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelues teach; How can this prieſt <hi>K.</hi> defend, that hee offereth vp Chriſt vnder the accidents of Bread and Wine, vnleſſe like the <hi>Iewes,</hi> he murder <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or at the leaſt deuoure him? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Adrian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Minutius Fu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>danus</hi> hath not theſe wordes, <hi>ne nomen condemnaretur, ſed crimen.</hi> as it is euident by the wordes of this Epiſtle reported by <hi>Iuſtine Martyr</hi> in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Apologie. Finally we do not oppugne Maſſe-prieſts for the name of prieſtes, as this dreaming ſuruey or imagineth, but for becauſe being made prieſtes beyond the Seas, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready at their creators the Popes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Princes, to trouble his ſtate, to rayſe ſedition, as the late attempts of <hi>Watſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Clarke,</hi> of <hi>Pearcy</hi> and his mates, ſet on by Prieſtes and <hi>Ieſuites</hi> to blow vp the whole Parliament, and to make a general maſſacre, and Rebellion, doe plainely declare.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond he telleth vs, <hi>that he is come from the great Monarch of heauen to ſalute the King;</hi> and that <hi>he is Gods Legate, and therfore not to be denyed audience, when the Ambaſſadors of the Kings of the earth are heard with ſo fauourable a countenance.</hi> But if
<pb facs="tcp:177778:9"/> he come from the Monarch of heauen, why doth he not ſhewe forth his warrant, and proue his heauenly &amp; angelical miſſion? If he be Gods true Legat, why doth he hide his falſe face? If he will be reſpected as earthly Ambaſſadors, then muſt he ſhewe forth a Commiſſion, as earthly Ambaſſadors doe. Otherwiſe he will be taken for the Legat of Sathan, ſet on by the Pope to write heretical diſcourſes and ſcurrilous Libels, to infect the peoples mindes with a diſtaſt of truth, and with ſuperſtitious, heretical and diſloyal humours, &amp; not Gods Ambaſſador ſent to the King, to declare his will. God certes neuer gaue any man commiſſion to perſwade the Popes tyrannical authoritye, the ſacrifice of the Maſſe for quicke &amp; dead, the 7. ſacraments, the worſhip of Saints and Images after the Romiſh facion, and ſuch like doctrines. Further he addeth <hi>That the loweſt Subiect may crye, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iue le Roy.</hi> But what maketh that for him, that held him-ſelfe for no ſubject of our late Queene being exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate by the Pope, &amp; thinketh it not lawful to ſubject himſelfe to the King, that now is, if the Pope ſhould take Armes againſt him, and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate him? Furthermore ſuch as he is, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be reputed tall and ſtout Traytors, then low or lowlie ſubjects, crying not <hi>viue le Roy,</hi> with any true heart, but as <hi>Iudas</hi> cryed, al hayle to Chriſt, when he betrayed him: or as <hi>Squire,</hi> that was ſent by the Ieſuite <hi>Walpoole</hi> to empoyſon the late Queene, cryed <hi>God ſaue the Queene,</hi> when he put poyſon on the Pommell of her Saddle. If then the Pope ſhall once beginne to diſplay his Banner and thunder out his excommunications againſt the King; then we are not to doubt, but as now <hi>Kelliſon</hi> cryeth, <hi>God ſaue the King,</hi> ſo then he would cry, downe with him, downe with him, and with all that followe him, and take parte with him. For ſuch as ment to blow him vp with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not being exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat, would not I think, ſpare him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſubject to the Popes thundring cenſures.</p>
            <p>For the third, hee anſweareth firſt, <hi>that it doth agrandiſe a Kinges greatnes, to accept of little preſentes.</hi> And next, <hi>that he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe as his Maieſties faithfull ſeruant.</hi> Laſtly he ſtandeth on ſtilts of high termes, and telleth vs, that <hi>he offereth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, the ſaluation and ſafetie of the King and his ſubiects, and the peace of his people.</hi> But neyther is his Booke a little preſent being a large fardle of waſt paper, nor can ſo big a lubber paſſe
<pb facs="tcp:177778:9"/> for a ſmall guift: although in truth both be of ſo low a price, that he might much be aſhamed to make offer of either to ſo iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious a Prince, but that he wanteth both ſhame &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Beſide that, it may be a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how he can giue himſelfe to the King, that hath already giuen himſelfe bodye and ſoule to the Pope, whoſe mark he carrieth on his ſhauen Crowne. A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Seruant, certes, hee cannot be to the King, ſeeing no man can ſerue two Maiſters. <hi>Pearcy</hi> promiſed as much as he. Yet ſought he the deſtruction of the King &amp; State, being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereto by Ieſuites, and led into treaſon by the rules of Popiſh Religion. As for the Maſſe and Doctrines of Poperie, which he bringeth with him, they leade to deſtruction, and not to ſaluation; they teach idolatrye, and not Gods true worſhip; error and Hereſie, and not true Faith. The Popes obedience is a yoke in ſupportable. His lawes are ſnares, of mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. His Prieſts and Fryars are the Locuſtes come out of the bothomleſſe pit of Hell. His Religion is neyther Catholike nor auncient, but rather a mixture of new and olde Hereſies. Neither can the King looke eyther for ſafety or peace ſo long as he ſuffereth a generation of viperous Prieſts and Friars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on an Arch-Prieſt to liue within the bowels of the State, and a packe of Papiſts to vphold the authority of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites vnder colour of Religion. Take away the Gun pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Papiſts, &amp; ſuch as had rather ſerue Antichriſt, then Chriſt, to bow their knees to <hi>Baalim</hi> then to worſhip God, and then you remoue the hopes of our enemies, that ſeek to diſturbe our peace, &amp; the firebra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of troubles, that are the likelieſt meanes to ſet all on a flame.</p>
            <p>To ſuch as demaund why hee dedicated this great bale of blotting paper to the King, he giueth this anſwere, <hi>that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want an anſwere, becauſe he cannot want a reaſon.</hi> And no doubt, but he imagined, that therein he did pindarize, and ſpeake ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eloquently. Yet many want anſweres, that haue farre more reaſon and honeſtie then he, &amp; diuers want no ready anſweres, that proceede without reaſon. Whatſoeuer hee pretendeth, little reaſon had he to offer this bundl e of papers to the King. For albeit learned men preſent their Bookes to Kings, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>nothing to bee well begunne, vnleſſe after God the King fauour it,</hi> as <hi>Vegetius</hi> affirmeth: yet this is nothing to this rude peece
<pb facs="tcp:177778:10"/> of worke, that is ſo fraught with calumniations and idle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, that neither God nor man can well ſeeme to fauour it. Further although the King <hi>delite in Bookes,</hi> and <hi>hath ſet foorth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers rare monuments of his rare wit and learning:</hi> yet doth hee not take pleaſure in ſuch ſcurrilous ſurueyes. Nor may we thinke, that a man of ſuch iudgement and learning can like or allowe ſuch baſe ſtuffe. Thirdly we confeſſe that the King is indeede, <hi>the protector of Religion, the Champion of the Church, and defender of the Faith.</hi> But little doth this auaile <hi>Kelliſons</hi> cauſe, who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth rather for jdolatrie and ſuperſtition, then Religion; for the ſinagogue of Antychriſt, rather then for Chriſts Church; for the errors and abuſes of Poperie, rather then for the faith of Chriſt. Fourthly it is not to be doubted, but that all the Kings true friendes did tryumph and make Bonfires at the Kings happie entrance into the Kingdome, and at his Coronation. But that ſheweth that the Ieſuites, Maſſe-prieſtes and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents are not the Kings true Friends. For they tryumph but a little at the Kings proſperitie, and many of them of late haue ſought inſteede of Bonfires, which this <hi>K.</hi> calleth <hi>Feux de Ioy,</hi> to ſet the Cittie vppon a fire, &amp; to blow vp the Parliament houſe and places adioyning with Gunne-powder. Other their conſorts are more deſirous to burne the bones &amp; bodies of Gods ſaints, then to make bonfires, when they vnderſtand of the Kinges proſperous ſucceſſe. Fiftly, wee acknowledge <hi>that God by his prouidence hath reſerued the King for the Crowne of England,</hi> &amp; quietly poſſeſſed him of his Crowne. But we know alſo that the Papiſts haue of late ſought to depriue him of his liberty, life, and Crowne. And <hi>Parſons</hi> and the Ieſuites of long time haue oppugned the Kings Title, both of them reſiſting not onely the Kings right, but alſo Gods prouidence. Finally if for all theſe fauours God expect at his Maieſties handes, that <hi>hee imploye himſelfe in ſome honorable ſeruice</hi> for the Catholike Church, and <hi>Chriſtes</hi> true faith, and for the deliuerance of his Realmes from Aegiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiuitie, and the reſtoring of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Catholike faith, as <hi>Kelliſon</hi> deſireth; then is hee to take a reſolute courſe for the remouing of al idolatrous Maſſe-prieſtes, which ſeduce his Subiectes, and turne them from the Catholike faith &amp; their alleageance, to imbrace humane tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the decretaline Doctrine of the Pope, and to prefer
<pb facs="tcp:177778:10"/> the Pope before their King. Then is he further to ouerthrow the groues of the jdolatrous Prieſtes, and to prouide that his Realmes be not againe entangled with a yoake of bondage, &amp; ouer-whelmed with ignorance, &amp; <hi>Aegiptian</hi> darkeneſſe. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he is to ſee, that Hereſies and falſe Doctrines bee not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnder the colour of Romiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>Moſt groſſely therefore hath this Romiſh Legat fayled in the proofes of his preſumptuous attempt, in preſenting his worthleſſe and trifling diſcourſes to the King. But hauing once paſſed the limits of modeſtie, he paſſeth himſelf in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, afterward aduenturing to preferre a ſute to the King for libertie to Papiſts, and for tolleration of Popiſh Religion. A matter, that with modeſtie cannot be mencioned to ſo pious a King, and by rules of Religion and ſtate may not be granted: For it is impious, Idolatrous, and heretical. And therfore may not be admitted of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. It is factious, rebellious &amp; deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory both to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prerogatiue of Princes, &amp; liberty of Subiects. And therfore not to be endured in any wel gouerned ſtate. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally themſelues admit no Religion contrarie to their owne falſe groundes, if they can doe withall. Why doe they then require that of others, that they yeeld not to others the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues? if he deny any point of theſe, he ſhall finde them iuſtified in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers anſwers framed to the importune ſupplycations of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, and wee ſhall alwaies be readye to prooue the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as oft as the matter ſhall come in queſtion.</p>
            <p>But had he reaſon to come to the King, yet he hath no reaſon to rayle on the Kings predeceſſor Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous memorie, as hee dooth, charging hir firſt with <hi>rayſing a ſtorme of perſecution,</hi> and next <hi>with the ruine of the Catholtke faith.</hi> Nay moſt falſely he chargeth a moſt clement and mercifull Queene with perſecution, and a Chriſtian Prince of ſingular pyetie, with hatred of Catholike Religion. Moſte falſely I ſay, for al her actes, and lawes doe argue an excellent moderation in her proceedings, againſt ſuch as moſte violentlye proſecuted her: and ſo farre was ſhe vrged to doe that ſhee did, that the ſecular Prieſtes not onely excuſe her for proceeding againſt Papiſts, but alſo to their vttermoſt defend her. Furthermore no chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Prince in our time ſhewed more zeale in the defence of true Catholike Religion, then ſhe. True it is, that ſhee fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:177778:11"/> not Popiſh errors. But nothing is more different then Popery and Catholike Religion. Neither ſhall this <hi>K.</hi> euer prooue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Hauing ended his idle diſcourſe concerning the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his book, he maketh bolde to begin his ſute for a tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popery. But his proceding is ſottiſh &amp; intollerable. <hi>He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the King</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>armed with hope, &amp; conſtrayned by neceſſitie in the name of the Kings Catholike ſubiects, in the name of the Catholike Church, in the name of all Catholike Princes, and of all the Chriſtian worlde, nay in the name of the great King of heauen and earth.</hi> But as the common Prouerbe is, <hi>The hilles trauaile, and out commeth a ridiculous Mouſe.</hi> For firſt what hope can this armed fellowe pretend, to obtaine fauourable audience either of the King, or State, that not onely rayleth on true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Kings true ſubjectes, but alſo pleadeth for ſuch, as of late ſought to deſtroye both the King and State? Againe how can he and his conſortes talke of comming armed with hope, when <hi>Cateſbie</hi> and his followers came armed with yron, to cut the Kings throte, and to take away our liues: and when his armes are not hope, nor arguments, but bitter Inuectiues, dartes of ſlaunder, and malicious fictions? Thirdly, no man is compelled by neceſſitie to play the Vice, and that without all colour or vizor of modeſtie. For what is more Vice-like, then for ſuch a pild compagnion, to pretend the name of all the Chriſtian worlde, and all Catholike Princes, being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſhewe commiſſion, either from any Prince, or any part of the Chriſtian worlde? Fourthlye, not onely all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, but alſo all Catholike Princes doe diſauow this preſumptuous fellowes pretended Commiſſion, renouncing his impious doctrine concerning the faith and Sacraments, his trecherous opinions concerning the Popes vſurped authority in depoſing and killing Chriſtian King's, his wicked defence of the worſhip of Saints and Angels, and all his idle declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lewd lyes, heatheniſh impoſtures, &amp; falſe doctrines &amp; hereſies. Fiftly, the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> (for the moſt part) doe euill deſerue the name of ſubjectes. But were they ranked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſubjectes, yet are they not to be ranked among Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, ſeeing they receiue the errors of the modern Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; erre in the faith. How-ſoeuer they think of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb facs="tcp:177778:11"/> they haue no reaſon to allowe their pild Proctors plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for others, who putteth them among theeues and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: and concludeth; that Papiſts are to haue a tolleration of their opinions, becauſe <hi>Theeues and murderers are now pardoned.</hi> We ſay his concluſion is weake and ſimple: For faultes once committed, are more eaſily pardoned, then a lycence graunted to commit faultes euer heer-after. Further, offences againſt our brethern, are more eaſilye remitted, then offences, that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly committed againſt God. Sixtly, if Princes that liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Pope, and are his vaſſals, would prefer any ſute to the King, they would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it to wiſer Agents, and not to ſuch a balde compagnion. Seuenthly, it is a groſſe conceit of a raw diuine, to thinke, that the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> world euer beleeued in the Popes triple Crowne, or guard of Switzers, or embraced the doctrine of the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> and Schoolmen concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Traditions, Sacraments, Purgatory, Indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, worſhip of Saints and Angels, and ſuch like poyntes of Popiſh ſayth. Finally, if this counterfet Legat doe not ſhew his Commiſſion vnder Seale, and plainly proue the Popes Decretales, the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> &amp; School-men, the Popes two ſwordes and all the traſh of Poperie; he is to be rejected as a frantike forger of newe Commiſſions, and diſauowed by his clyents, as a fooliſh and ſimple pleader.</p>
            <p>His reaſons for tolleration of Popery, are either grounded vpon falſe poſitions, or elſe want forme of good concluſions. That which he ſayth of the Kinges Predeceſſors, that <hi>with Crowne, Scepter and Sword,</hi> they mainteyned the moderne doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, is vtterly falſe. For they neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that the Pope had power to take away their Crownes, or that Chriſtians (like Canibals) did eate Chriſts fleſh with their teeth, and ſwallowe it downe into their bellyes, or other moderne Romiſh errors, hereſies and impieties. But did any ancient Princes maintaine errors, that bindeth not their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to continue therein. We are not to folowe the ſteppes of our parents, where them-ſelues tread awrye. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> left the Paganiſme of his aunceſtors. The auncient Kinges of <hi>Spayne</hi> were <hi>Arians,</hi> yet doe the later Kinges of <hi>Spayne</hi> deteſt <hi>Arianiſme.</hi> Falſe it is alſo that the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> in time paſt were of the ſame faith, which this <hi>Kelliſon</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:177778:12"/> at <hi>Doway.</hi> It may bee they built Abbeyes, worſhipped Saints, &amp; vſed ſome popiſh ceremonies more then chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> required. But <hi>K.</hi> muſt prooue, that they beleeued the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; al the Popes decretales, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in jdolatrie, as groſſely and obſtinately, as the Papiſts doe now, or elſe hee trifleth out time in vaine. Thirdly hee ſpeaketh not onely falſely but alſo abſurdly, where he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth honour to ſuch Princes, as imbrace Poperie. For what can be more diſhonorable, then for Kings to become vaſſals, to loſe halfe their Subjects, halfe their authoritye, halfe their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues? doth <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſuppoſe it honorable for Kings to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, depoſed, killed? or can any free Engliſh man endure to be ſubiect to <hi>Italians</hi> and ſtrangers? Fourthly, vainely doth this declaimer promiſe <hi>felicitie to the Realme,</hi> declyning to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. There can be no greater bondage, nor miſerie for mens ſoules, then to be entangled with popiſh lawes, traditions and cenſures. Baſe it is to endure the Maſſe-prieſtes extortions and pillages, greeuous to ſee the land deuoured by Caterpillers. Fiftly we confeſſe, it is honorable to conquer Hereſie; but this honor belongeth not to Princes blinded with poperie: which is nothing elſe but a maſſe or compendium of diuers hereſies. Contrarywiſe if Maſſe-prieſts were rooted out, and Gods true Religion in euerie quarter ſincerely receiued; then ſhould we neither feare the wrath of God threatned againſt jdolaters and contemners of Religion, nor the enmitie &amp; oppoſition of men hauing no meanes to hurt vs, but by the practiſes &amp; mutinies of Papiſts. Sixtly, neither is the Religion profeſſed in England <hi>new,</hi> nor is popery <hi>old.</hi> And therein I wil ioyne iſſue with this Surueyor, if hee dare maintaine the contrarye. Hee braggeth much, but the ſurfet of popery hath diſtempered his wits. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly it was honorable, we confeſſe, for <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to reſtore Chriſtian Religion. But what maketh this for poperie, which was not in the world in the daies of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> nor many ages after? Furthermore when <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſhall be at any leyſure, and not troubled with his Gunpowder plots of high treaſon, then we will ſhew and prooue to his teeth, that poperie is a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, &amp; a declination fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtian Religion to errors &amp; hereſies. Finally, to ſecure the Kings life, and the peace of the State, this wiſe Orator offereth oathes. But Chriſtian people
<pb facs="tcp:177778:12"/> are too well acquainted with the practiſes of Papiſts to truſt them eyther vpon oathes, bands, or pledges. Of late while they were moſte forward to offer oathes, and all ſecuritie that could be deuiſed, then <hi>Pearcy</hi> and his mates were ſitting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnder the Parliament houſe, and laying a plot for a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maſſacre of all true Chriſtians, and for a Rebellion of al diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Perſons, and Papiſts. Further they teach that oathes are not to be performed to Hereticks, &amp; eaſily doth the Pope diſpence with them. Who then is ſo patient as to endure this ſimple fellowes fooliſh prating? theſe cut-throate Prieſtes will murder honeſt men, &amp; their ſoules ſhal ſue them for periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! is not this (trow you) a goodly deuice?</p>
            <p>Whether he ſpeake for his owne cauſe, or againſt vs, his idle talke is not much to be regarded, that either affirmeth matters nakedly vpon his owne bare word, or bringeth no better wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then <hi>Nicol Borne, Genebrard, Baronius, Thomas Aquinas,</hi> &amp; ſuch like, or alleadgeth Scriptures impertinently and falſelye, or elſe belyeth his aduerſaries ſhamefully. Againſt <hi>Caluin</hi> hee bringeth a place out of his Inſtitutions, as if he taught, <hi>that by religion men might diſobey Princes lawes:</hi> a matter neither taught, nor euer thought vpon by him. To what end then bringeth he allegations out of Scriptures and Fathers, to diſprooue this rebellious poſition? would hee haue all the world to ſee, that Papiſts diſobeying Princes vpon the Popes warrant repugne both to Scriptures and Fathers?</p>
            <p>His skill in Diuinitie we may eaſily conjecture not to be ſingular. For firſt he preferreth the will of man in his conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, before Gods grace. <hi>Religion</hi> ſayth he, <hi>is not tranſfuſed with fleſh and blood, but infuſed by God, with conſent of our will, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace.</hi> Secondly, he maketh mans blood an oblation for ſinne, and a mediation of others conuerſion. Thirdly, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth <hi>Aureolam martyrum,</hi> that is, a degree aboue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon glory of Gods Saints, as a rewarde due to Martyrs for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion. Fourthly, he ſayth <hi>Many <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins haue liued in the fleſh like Angels.</hi> But to ſay that man can liue without ſinne, is <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gianiſme.</hi> Laſtly, his groundes are out of <hi>Tho. Aquinas,</hi> and the School-men. Is it then like that his Babylonian building wil long ſtand?</p>
            <p>His notable ſimplicitie is euery where apparant. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:177778:13"/> king the Kings fauour, he rayleth on Religion profeſſed by the King. Pleading for the Pope, he ouerthroweth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Pope. For if the authoritie of Kings be from God, then cannot Popes diſcharge ſubjectes from their dutie and obedience to Princes. Shewing him-ſelfe vnable to write or to diſpute, yet moſt ſimply he chalengeth vs all into the field, offring to diſpute with vs. Laſtly, wanting other meanes, he maketh the King a petitioner vnto him-ſelfe.</p>
            <p>His honeſty cannot be great, that rayleth againſt the dead, flattereth ſuch as are able to fauour him, belyeth both the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and dead. <hi>By Popes</hi> ſayth he <hi>alwayes Countryes haue beene conuerted.</hi> Yet for many yeares haue they giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer preaching, and lately haue ſuffered the Turkiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eniambe &amp; get ground vpon <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> He ſaith further, <hi>That our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan but yeſterday,</hi> that <hi>our teachers want authoritie,</hi> that <hi>our doctrine hath the markes of hereſie,</hi> that <hi>we pull at Chriſts diuinitie, make him no redeemer, ſpirituall Phiſitian, law-giuer, Prieſt, nor Iudge, but make him ignorant, deſperate and damned.</hi> He chargeth vs further that <hi>we haue neither Prieſt, Sacrifice, Sacrament, nor Prayer:</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters impudently and without all colour of truth auowched, as ſhall plainly appeare by our anſwer. If, when he commeth to diſpute, he bring no more truth, Children will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iſſe him out of Schooles for an impudent and lying compagnion.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the principall poyntes and whole ſomme of this rude Orators pleading before his Majeſtie, wherein no dout he hath made the faireſt ſhew he could of ſuch baſe wares; We may eaſily imagine, that his ſpeech to the common reader is more rude, harſh, and diſioynted. In the beginning of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, he ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth out like a wilde diſcourſer, into a long ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and vnreaſonable ſpeach concerning <hi>inanimate &amp; vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures.</hi> But it muſt needes be a dull, dead, and vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable cauſe, that hath ſuch dead &amp; vnreaſonable aduocates to plead for it. He turneth the Sunne into a Cocke, &amp; a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and birds into Carpenters, &amp; brute beaſtes into hearbiſts. But whereto tendeth this brutiſh diſcourſe, voyde both of the light of the Sunne, and of the light of reaſon? doth he place his conſortes among feathered fooles, or elſe among brute beaſts? from ſenceleſſe creatures (in which ranke we may place a good parte of this Surueyer and his conſortes) he leapeth to
<pb facs="tcp:177778:13"/> brute beaſtes, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brute beaſtes to man. And yet nothing he writeth, that may beſeeme a ſenſible creature, much leſſe a reaſonable and diſcreete man. The end and marke of all his wilde vagary is this, to ſhewe, that <hi>becauſe God hath giuen vs a will wholy bent to good,</hi> and an <hi>vnderſtanding naturally enclined to truth, &amp; auerted from all vntruthes,</hi> he hath therfore <hi>made an exact Suruey of the new Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as he ſaith. But firſt theſe things hang no better together then if he ſhould ſay he would to <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Totnam</hi> is foure miles from <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> is turned Spaniſh. For man may haue an vnderſtanding and will, and yet frame no ſuch falſe ſurueyes. Nay if this ſurueyor had either had any vnderſtanding, or good purpoſe, he would neuer haue imployed his labour in ſuch a lewde peece of ſeruice. Further neither dooth mans wil deſire any good thing tending to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, or vnderſtand any ſuch thing, ſo long as he is vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by Gods grace. The wordes of the Apoſtle are cleare. <hi>There dwelleth no go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d thing in my fleſh.</hi> And againe, <hi>the naturall man vnderſtandeth not the things that are of God.</hi> Thirdly, if mans will &amp; vnderſtanding had beene ſo inclined, as he pretendeth; then would <hi>Kelliſon</hi> neuer haue liued vnder the yoke of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, nor beleeued the abſurdities of popiſh Religion: of which we ſhall ſpeake God willing, particularly heereafter. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo farre is his ſuruey from exactneſſe, as a ſurfet of foolery from ſound vnderſtanding and reaſon. Finally, nothing ſhall this <hi>K.</hi> bee able to alleadge in our Religion, that abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth eyther from reaſon, or rule of good vnderſtanding. The miſſion and calling of our Biſhops and Miniſters ſhal be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt all the barking of Maſſe-Prieſtes and Ieſuites. <hi>The markes of Hereticks</hi> ſhall be wiped from our ſelues, &amp; deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted vpon our aduerſaries. Our Doctrine ſhal be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the vniuſt imputations of our aduerſaries, and euerie indifferent man ſatisfied, that <hi>we neither empayre Chriſtes honor,</hi> nor deny his <hi>Preeſthood.</hi> But contrariwiſe the Papiſts commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate <hi>Chriſts</hi> honor to creatures, &amp; his preeſt-hood to Maſſe-Prieſtes. We ſhall alſo proue by plaine euidence, that we vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde <hi>the authoritie of Princes and their lawes,</hi> which the Papiſts ouerthowe and deſpiſe. Wee doubt not further to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, that none of vs euer taught, <hi>that God is author of ſinne,</hi> or <hi>cruell,</hi> or <hi>tyrannicall</hi> in his proceedings. Finally, we ſhould bee
<pb facs="tcp:177778:14"/> much aſhamed, if vices and all impieties were not better cenſured and puniſhed in <hi>England,</hi> then in <hi>Italy, Spaine,</hi> and other popiſh Countries.</p>
            <p>Theſe matters which <hi>Kelliſon</hi> vanteth, that hee will make good againſt vs, haue been not onely formerly obiected vnto vs by <hi>William Raynoldes</hi> and <hi>D.

Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> reſteth eyther ſatisfied, or ſilent. If then this new ſuruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or would needes renew their ſlaunders and vaine obiections, he ſhould for his credit ſake haue doone wel, eyther to haue replyed to our anſwere, or to haue held his peace, as his betters haue done. Againe if hee had beene ſo wiſe and circumſpect, as he pretendeth to bee; he would haue been well aduiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entred this courſe, leaſt he might giue vs occaſion to rip vp the deformities, fooleries, abſurdities, Hereſies, impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and other abuſes of Popery, of which I doubt not, but his beſt friendes, when they are laid open, will bee much aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Himſelfe being but a new vpſtart Doctor, &amp; lately crept out of my Lord <hi>Vauxes</hi> Buttery, will bee much puzled to make any probable defence for them.</p>
            <p>Thus much may ſerue for anſwere to the front of his Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey and his two liminare Epiſtles. For the reſt, I ſhall not neede to ſay much in this place. Onely this, I thought good to ſignifye vnto thee, good Reader, that thou looke not for any curious or long anſwere heereafter: to wit, that the whole vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume is nothing but a newe packe of olde calumniations and lyes. The forme of his diſcourſe is trifling, the Subject ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Such declamations, it ſhould ſeeme hee was wont in the time of his butlerage to make ouer a canne of Beere. His proofes are fancies and bare conceites. His witneſſes, fellowes of a lowe price. His concluſions weake collections. It may bee, eyther neede and hunger, or elſe hope and promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made him ſo talkatiue. How be it leaſt hee might grow proud of his owne proweſſe, I haue vndertaken to ſhape him a ſhort anſwere. In the meane while, concerning his obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and proofes, this hee may learne of mee for his inſtruction. Firſt that it is a fooliſh thing for a man to obiect that to others, whereof they are cleare, and hee moſte guiltie: and to ſuruey o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:177778:14"/> mens eſtates, when his owne can abide no ſuruey. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the boſome and domeſticall teſtimonies of <hi>Cochleus, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrard, Bolſec, Stapleton</hi> and ſuch like are little to be eſteemed. <hi>Fidele eſt teſtimonium quod cauſas non habet mentiendi. That teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome ad Saluinam, deſerueth moſt credit, that hath no cauſes of fiction.</hi> Be not then mooued with the largeneſſe of <hi>Kelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> volume, nor with his manifold leaſings. Common bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are wont to put in longeſt billes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue leaſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and ſhallow waters make moſte noiſe. To ſuch lewd and long lies, this our ſhort anſwere will be more then ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Vouchſafe therefore to compare both our diſcourſes together, and to reade them with indifferency. And ſo thou ſhalt ſoone diſcouer the vanitie of his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and giue ſentence for our innocency.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it be the part of a wiſe builder to</hi> lay a firme foundation, as our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt <hi>Math.</hi> 7.</hi> teacheth, and common experience prooueth moſt euidently vnto vs; then we may wel collect, that <hi>Kelliſon</hi> our aduerſary, in his Suruey, hath ſhewed himſelfe neither wiſe builder, nor wiſe man, who in his firſt booke going about to build the Toure of his Romiſh <hi>Babel</hi> doth wholy miſtake his foundations, laying the frame of his worke eyther vpon the Pope, whome he ſuppoſeth to be a viſible Iudge of all controuerſies, or vpon the miſſion and preaching of Romiſh Maſſe prieſtes. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, talking of our Religion, he doth groſſely erre in the foundations of it, ſuppoſing that it relyeth, firſt <hi>vpon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of our Preachers,</hi> then vpon their allegations out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, thirdly vpon mens priuate ſpirits, fourthly vpon credible or probable teſtimonies, and laſtly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome viſible Iudge: mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (certes) rather deuiſed by him ſelfe, then taught by vs. The viſible Iudge, and authoritie of Prieſtes, is layd as a foundation of fayth by <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his booke of doctrinal principles. That which he talketh of priuat ſpirits, and the allegatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scriptures
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177778:16"/> out of mens own humors, is an imputation of Papiſts layd vpon vs and that moſt vniuſtly. For we build the Church vpon the Prophets and Apoſtles. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> him ſelfe being the cheefe corner ſtone, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs <hi>Epheſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we receiue, not as they are interpreted by the Maſſeprieſts, or any mans humorous fancy, but as they procéed from the ſpirit of God by the miniſtery of his Prophets and Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore miſtaking the foundation of the worke, we may well imagine, that his diſcourſe, that is a worke rayſed either without foundation, or beſide the foundation, is moſt vaine, idle, and abſurd. The firſt Chapter of his firſt booke, he beginneth with a long declamatory narration, proouing, that no man is to intrude him ſelfe into the function of the miniſtery of the Church without miſſion. But what is that to the foundation of religion, which is the ſubiect which he promiſed to handle? Doth he ſuppoſe, that the principal foundation of his Maſſing religion is layd vpon the preaching, or rather not preaching &amp; miſſion of pol-ſhorne prieſts ſent out by the Pope to ſay Maſſe for quicke and dead? if he doe, then like as his gunpowder conſortes went about of late to blow vp the King and Sate, ſo doth he goe obout to blow vp the Popes Chayre together with all his Cardinals, Friars, Monkes, and Maſſe-prieſtes.</p>
               <p>For, firſt the Pope ſhall neuer be able to proue his miſſion. <hi>Epheſ. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> wee read, that Chriſt gaue ſome Apoſtles, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome Paſtors, and Teachers. But the Pope is none of all theſe. His ſtate is too great to be conteyned within this ſmall and weake number. <hi>Further</hi> he is no ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter.</hi> For he rather killeth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féedeth Chriſts ſhéep. <hi>Thirdly</hi> he rather medleth with Swordes, then Keyes; and if he handleth the Keyes of the Church, yet can he ſhewe no Commiſſion for it. <hi>Fourthly</hi> he is abſurd, if he clayme the right of a Biſhop. For he doth not the worke of a Biſhop. Laſtly the Apoſtles Succeſſors, and Preachers ſent from God procéed according to their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Inſtructions receiued from God. But the Pope procéed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to his owne Decretales and the rules of his owne Chancery. Out then muſt he goe, and all that pretend to come from him as méere intruders, if we folowe the Apoſtles rules.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals are but of a late ſtanding. <hi>S. Peter</hi> had no Cardinals about him. Nor were the pariſh Prieſts of <hi>Rome</hi> that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177778:16"/> aſſiſted the auncient Biſhops of that Cittie ſo gallant fellowes, as theſe new Cardinals are. They neither preach nor Baptiſe as Cardinals. And therefore cannot pretend right of ſucceſſion, eyther from the Apoſtles, or from auncient Biſhops or Prieſtes. In the holy Scriptures, albeit ſome alleadge the wordes <hi>Cardines terrae,</hi> there is no mention of them. Finallye the Fathers knew them not. If then the Popes decretales warrant them not; theſe <hi>Cardines terrae,</hi> or rather terren and carnall Cardinalls, may goe in <hi>vltimos fines terrae,</hi> that is into the vtmoſte endes of the earth to ſeeke for their miſſion.</p>
               <p>The Monkes and Fryars are no where mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vnleſſe it be <hi>Apocalypſ. 9.</hi> Where wée finde, that Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtes did iſſue out of the ſmoke of the bothomleſſe pit, whereby is ſignified, that by their ſmoky traditions they ſhould obſcure the light of the Goſpell. They ſucceede not Paſtors and Teachers. For their profeſſion is pouertie, chaſtitie and obedience to mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh rules, and not to teach or adminiſter Sacraments. <hi>Hierome</hi> and all antiquitie put monkes after Prieſts, and range them in another order. Fryars entred but lately into the Church vnder the conduct of <hi>Dominicke</hi> and <hi>Francis.</hi> Their authoritie is wholy from the Pope: and other commiſſion can they ſhew none. Maſſe-prieſtes are not ſent to preach and adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but to ſacrifice Chriſts bodie and blood vnder the accidents of bread and wine, for quick and dead, as appeareth in the formall wordes of their ordination. But ſuch a miſſion is no where found in Scripture. For our Sauiour inſtituting the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>accipite, edite, bibite.</hi> That is, <hi>take, eate, drinke,</hi> and not, <hi>ſacrificate pro viuis et defunctis,</hi> that is, <hi>Sacrifice for quicke &amp; dead.</hi> True it is, that he ſaith, <hi>hoc facite</hi> that is, <hi>doe this.</hi> But <hi>hoc facere</hi> doth no where eyther in Scripture or prophane Authors ſignifie ſacrifice this. <hi>Virgil</hi> is alleadged, where one ſaith <hi>cum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam vitula.</hi> But if they bring no better proofes, the Maſſe-prieſts will prooue themſelues as wiſe as Calues. For it is one thing to ſay, <hi>facere vitula,</hi> and <hi>facere hoc.</hi> Beſide that, <hi>Virgil</hi> yet was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eſteemed a good interpreter of Chriſtes wordes. To omitte Scriptures, this ſacrificing Preeſt-hood of the Romaniſtes, hath no proofe out of Fathers. For no where in any authenticall writing of theirs is any mention made of ſuch an ordination. Nay it is apparant, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſame was firſt talked of by idle Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177778:17"/> and authorized after a ſort by the conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> vnder <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth. Finally, neither doe Scriptures, nor Fathers mention any ſuch real, carnal, and corporall ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body and blood made in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> vnder the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes of breade and wine for the ſinnes of the quicke and dead, as I haue fully demonſtrated in my Bookes <hi>de m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſa</hi> againſt <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> Nay, the Canon it ſelfe dooth ſignifie, that the ſacrifice of the Church is offered as well by the people as the Prieſt, as theſe words declare, <hi>qui tibi offerunt.</hi> But the Papiſts wil not ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people offereth vp Chriſts body. Further the Maſſe-prieſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God would be pleaſed to accept the ſacrifice: but it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to make a Maſſe-prieſt mediator for <hi>Chriſts</hi> body and blood. If then they bee falſe <hi>Prophets, Theeues,</hi> &amp; <hi>Robbers,</hi> that come without miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ſufficient warrant; then are the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> Cardinals, Monkes, Fryars and Maſſe-prieſts falſe Prophets, Theeues, and Robbers. And that may in part alſo bee prooued, by the confeſſion of our aduerſarie. For if, (as hee ſaith) all are to bée reputed ſuch, that can neither ſhew ordinarie calling from the Apoſtles, nor extraordinarie from the ſpirit of God; then are they to bee ſhunned as falſe Prophets and falſe teachers, and puniſhed ſeuerely, not onely as men lately beſmired with Gunne-powder, but alſo as falſe Theeues &amp; Robbers. For extraordinarie calling they pretend none, &amp; ordinarie calling authorized by Gods word, they haue none, as hath in part beene prooued. Further we ſay, that whereas two thinges are to be reſpected in ordination of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops &amp; Miniſters of Gods word, <hi>viz.</hi> the rite of ordination, &amp; the ſubſtance of the function, whereto they are ordeyned; in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Church, our aduerſaries haue neither of theſe two lawfull. Firſt they haue no impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands by Biſhops. For they haue no lawful Biſhops, &amp; allow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hands of Abbots. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Biſhops are no ſucceſſors of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is rather a temporal prince, then a Biſhop. The Monks and Fryars are rather called to doe pennance then to preach, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſhorne. Secondly their Prieſts are not called to preach and baptiſe, which was the forme and ſubſtance of the miſſion of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, but to ſacrifice Chriſtes body and blood vnder the accidents of breade and wine for quicke and dead: which forme and function, neither <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> nor all the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Romiſh Prieſts and Fryars, ſhall euer prooue to bee aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177778:17"/> lawful, or authenticall.</p>
               <p>Againſt our Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons, no ſuch matter can be excepted. For firſt it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denyed but that our Biſhops were lawfully ordeined by impoſition of handes of other lawfull Biſhops. The Ordination of Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> &amp; other Biſhops then liuing, the Papiſtes themſelues cannot deny to be lawfull. But from them other Biſhops folowing receiued the rite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> was conſecrated by the impoſition of handes of Biſhop <hi>Barloe,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Couerdale,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Scory,</hi> and two Suffragans, mentioned in the Acte of conſecration yet to be ſeene: which not onely had ſucceſſion from ſuch Biſhops as our aduerſaries account lawfull, but in deede were lawfull Biſhops. Our bretherne in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Zuizzerland</hi> had impoſition of handes from <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Bucer</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: in <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Farel,</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Knox</hi> and others, whome the Papiſtes cannot deny to haue bene lawfully ordeined Prieſts, at the leaſt if their owne formes were lawfull. And from theſe men &amp; their ſucceſſors, al other Paſtors &amp; Miniſters of the Church, haue receiued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rite of impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of handes, or ordination to the Miniſtery. Neither is it materiall, that the firſt preachers of the Gpſpel in theſe Countries were not Biſhops, and ſo called, as it was in <hi>England.</hi> For ſuppoſe no Biſhop would haue renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the hereſyes of Popery, nor haue taught ſincerely: ſhould not inferiour miniſters teach truth, and ordeine other teachers after them? Furthermore, they wanted nothing of true Biſhops, but the name and tytle. Finally the rite and impoſition of handes by ſuch as are called Biſhops is not ſo neceſſary, but that in a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops of a nation, and in caſe of other extreme neceſſitye, Miniſters may lawfully be ordained by other Miniſters: which is prooued firſt, for that generally the Preſbytery or Miniſtery of the Church hath right to impoſe handes, and next for that the Keyes are called <hi>Claues Eccleſiae,</hi> and not <hi>Claues Epiſcoporum:</hi> and laſtly for that neceſſitie admitteth not the obſeruance of all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes. As for example, admit a multitude of Chriſtians ſhould goe into the <hi>Indiaes</hi> without miniſters, it is not to be ſuppoſed, but they haue power to appoint Miniſters among them ſelues in this caſe of neceſſitye.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is certaine, that the Biſhops and Miniſters of reformed Churches haue bene ſent to preach and ſo adminiſter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177778:18"/> the Sacraments, by ſuch as had authoritye in the Church, and that they haue executed their function accordingly. Why then ſhould any deny them to be truly the Apoſtles ſucceſſors?</p>
               <p>Finally, the defection of ordinary Prieſtes in the Romiſh Church being extraordinary, we may not imagine, that all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rites and formes were to be obſerued in the vocation of ſuch, as by the inſtinct of Gods holy ſpirit were ſtirred vp extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to reſtore the decayed partes and ruines of Gods Temple.</p>
               <p>But ſayth <hi>Kelliſon <hi>pag.</hi> 9. If their Preachers be ſent by an ordinary miſſion, let them ſhewe their ſucceſſion.</hi> And heere hee alleageth <hi>Tertullians</hi> wordes <hi>lib. de praeſcript. aduerſ. haeret.</hi> concerning the orders of Biſhops, and ſucceſſion from the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. And two places out of <hi>S. Auguſtine, <hi>in Pſal. contr. part. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>contr. epiſt. fund.</hi> where he ſpeaketh of the ſucceſſion of Biſhops. Againe, he vrgeth vs, if any thing were extraordinary in thoſe, which firſt reformed the Church, to prooue their miſſion by miracles; and runneth into a long diſcourſe of the viſibilitie of the Church, of miracles and propheſies. To which wee anſwere firſt, that if the ſucceſſion of Biſhops were the onelye proofe of an ordinarie miſſion, the Papiſts themſelues were in bad tearmes hauing no proofes of their ſucceſſion of popes ſo much bragged of, but the teſtimony of <hi>Anaſtaſius, Platina, Naucler, Sabellicus, Onuphrius, Genebrard, Baronius</hi> &amp; ſuch like hungrie paraſites of the Pope iarring and contending one againſt another like maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye Curres about a bone. Secondly the <hi>Greekes, Antiochians</hi> and <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> pretend to this day ſucceſſion of Biſhops, and yet are groſſely fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faith, &amp; want true Biſhops. Thirdly, <hi>Tertullian</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeak of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Biſhops, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> denyeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee Biſhops or paſtors, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a Biſhop, who was not ordered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nities. Fourthly, we ſhew ſuch a ſucceſſion of Biſhops, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not controle, deriuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning order &amp; externall formes from Biſhops allowed by our aduerſaries, and concerning ſucceſſion of Doctrine from the Apoſtles, Fathers and auncient Biſhops of the primitiue Church. Fiftly the queſtion concerning the viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Church is diuers from that, which concerneth ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For I hope <hi>K.</hi> will not ſay, that hee euer ſaw the ſucceſſion of Romiſh Biſhops, or that any Apoſtle ſaw his ſucceſſors. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee alleage that the old Prophets were ſent extraordinarily,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177778:18"/> and yet wrought no miracles. Diuers apoſtolicall men likewiſe haue beene rayſed vp by God at diuers times, and yet wee reade not, that eyther all of them prophecied, or wrought miracles.</p>
               <p>This being our anſwere, of which <hi>Kelliſon</hi> could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but that hee is eyther ignorant of matters in queſtion, or elſe voide of honeſty and good dealing; what is it, I pray you, that hee is able to alleadge againſt the vocation and miſſion of Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in our Churches? Firſt ſaith he, <hi>Page. <hi>11. They ſay, that the Apoſtles which were the firſt Biſhops and Paſtors had for a time their lawfull ſucceſſors, but that at the length the church fayled, and the Paſtors with it.</hi>
                  </hi> But while he talketh of miſſion he lyeth ſhamefully and without all commiſſion. For firſt wee diſtinguiſh both Biſhops and ordinarie paſtors from Apoſtles. So doth the Apoſtle alſo, <hi>Ephe. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> Secondly we deny, that Chriſts Church euer hath fayled. Thirdly wee teach, that the Apoſtles haue alwaies had ſome ſucceſſors, albeit neither in one place, nor without all interruption. If then he haue not fayled in true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, let him ſet downe the authors names, that haue affirmed this which hee reporteth, and relate their words ſincerely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>age. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </hi> he addeth, that <hi>Luther <hi>diſobeyed the Pope and the Church, and deuiſed a new Religion to cloake his villany.</hi>
                  </hi> But firſt the Pope and the Church are euill yoaked together. For Chriſts ſheepe heare not the voice of ſtrangers. Secondly theſe words of villany come out of his ſhop of mallice. Laſtly neuer ſhall this <hi>K.</hi> prooue that <hi>Luther</hi> deuiſed any new Religion. For he onely impugned late errors, and ſought to bring Chriſtians backe to the auncient Catholike faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he ſhapeth an other anſwere for vs <hi>Page. 14.</hi> &amp; maketh vs to ſay, <hi>that wee had predeceſſors, but they were inuiſible.</hi> But this abuſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he offereth vs, is too groſſe &amp; palpable for neither doe we make our predeceſſors inuiſible. Nor doe we denie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ancient fathers &amp; holy Biſhops of old time, as they taught the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke and apoſtolike faith, and no more, were out predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly hee telleth vs, that ſuch as pretend <hi>extraordinarie ſending runne vnſent.</hi> But he taketh vppon him too too arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantlye to limit Gods power, and ſeemeth plainely to contradict Gods word. S. <hi>Paul <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4,</hi> mencioneth Euangeliſts without limitation either of times or places, and Saint <hi>Iohn <hi>Apocaly.</hi> 11</hi> foreſheweth, that God will giue power to his two witneſſes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177778:19"/> preaching againſt the Kingdome of Antichriſt, and the abuſes of their times. Neither doth either <hi>Optatus</hi> or <hi>Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle ſpeake any word againſt vs herein. <hi>Optatus <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> ſpeaketh of ſome intruding donatiſts: &amp; <hi>Cyprian,</hi> of certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous <hi>Nouatians,</hi> which as the Arch-prieſts &amp; Ieſuites and Maſſe-prieſts doe in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, thruſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues into the miniſterie in <hi>Africk</hi> without warrant. The Apoſtle <hi>Eph. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> leaueth out the Pope &amp; therefore ouerthroweth our aduerſaries cauſe. But hee ſaith not one word, why Paſtors and teachers may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time either hee ſent extraordinarily, or furniſhed with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie power. Finally albeit the Church be built vpon a Rocke, yet particular Churches &amp; Citties may fall into errors, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can bee reformed without ſome extraordinarie helpes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly he affirmeth <hi>Page. <hi>19.</hi> that extraordinarie miſſion is alwaies to be prooued by extraordinarie ſignes and tokens of Prophecies or miracles.</hi> And to this purpoſe hee feyneth that both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> endeuoured to prophecy and to worke miracles. But the firſt is diſprooued by the examples of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles. For neither doe we reade, that all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wrought miracles, nor that all the Apoſtles propheſied. Furthermore the Godly Martyrs of old time, and the auncient Biſhops were often indued with extraordinarie graces: yet did they not all worke wonders and prophecy. The ſecond is diſproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued both by our Doctrine and practiſe. For neither doe wee now practiſe miracles, or ſtand vpon prophecies, nor doe wée teach, that the Doctrine of truth is to be confirmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> miracles or prophecies. To conuince vs, this <hi>K.</hi> produceth the teſtimonye of <hi>Cochle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Surius, Staphylus, Genebrard, Fontanus, Bolſec,</hi> and ſuch like fellowes. But their teſtimonies are not worth a Nut-ſhell, being hired to ſpeake ſhame of the popes aduerſaries. Hee is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie light of beleefe, that giueth credit to the wordes eyther of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or hired paraſites.</p>
               <p>Finally he concludeth <hi>Page. <hi>28. that we haue no aſſurance of our Religion by the authoritie of our Preachers, being able to ſay no more then falſe Apoſtles for proofe of their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</hi>
                  </hi> Hee doubteth not alſo to affirme, <hi>that both <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and thoſe of the family of Loue, may as well alleadge Scriptures,</hi> and pretend to bee ſent of God, as <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi> But firſt he ſheweth himſelfe a ſimple Doctor of Diuinitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teacheth, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177778:19"/> the authoritie of preachers is a ſufficient aſſurance for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to builde their Religion and faith vpon. As for vs wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them no further, then they treade in the ſteps, and continue in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets of God. Secondly it is not ſufficient to alleadge or pretend Scriptures, but they muſt bee truelye alleadged. Neither is the priuate fancie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie capriecious head to be equalled with the determinations of graue men, and well experimented in Scriptures. Laſtlye, there is no compariſon betweene learned men called and allowed by the Church, &amp; phantaſticall fellowes, that raſhly preſume to leape into the miniſteriall function without eyther calling, allowance, or qualities fitting for ſuch a calling.</p>
               <p>In his ſecond chapter he ſhameth not to ſay, <hi>that thoſe which ground their Religion on Scriptures,</hi> (which hee like a bad and bare fellow calleth bare) <hi>ſet the gate open to all Heretickes and Hereſies.</hi> Thus our aduerſaries aduauncing the Popes decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, and the vncertaine tradiſions of the Romiſh Church, deteſt the holy Scriptures, and open their mouthes againſt God. But wee are rather to beleeue <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, then ſuch blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous gapers and ſpeakers againſt holy Scriptures. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Epheſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith the faithfull are built vppon the Apoſtles and prophets. <hi>Epheſ. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </hi> the word of God is called the ſword of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit. And <hi>2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</hi> The ſcripture is commended as <hi>profitable to inſtruct and reproue,</hi> and <hi>able to make the man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi> But neither may the ground of faith be tearmed a gate ſet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Hereſies, nor is the ſword of the ſpirit a meanes to breede errors. Further how can the ſame be a gate ſet open to heretikes being able to make the man of God perfit? certes if the allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scriptures were a way to error, our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> would neuer haue ſent his hearers to ſearch ſcriptures. Neither would the auncient Fathers haue termed Scriptures <hi>a canon of faith,</hi> if they had beene any gate ſet open to Hereſies. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in his third booke againſt Hereſies, ſaith <hi>the Apoſtles firſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpell, and afterwards deliuered the ſame to vs in Scriptures, that it might be a foundation &amp; pillar of our faith.</hi> He ſheweth alſo, that it is the propertie of Heretikes, <hi>when they are conuinced by Scriptures, to accuſe the Scriptures, and to ſpeake euill of them. <hi>Origen</hi>
                  </hi> in <hi>Math. tract. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </hi> ſheweth, <hi>that Scriptures are to be brought for proofe of all Doctrines.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177778:20"/> neede we to doubt, but that of themſelues, they are verie ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Our Sauiour <hi>Math. 4.</hi> by Scriptures onely ouercame the Diuell. Neither did the auncient Fathers by other weapons preuaile againſt Hereticks. In generall councels of olde time not the Popes decretales, but the holy Scriptures were laide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fathers. Laſtly if the word of God cannot be receiued, it is farre more vnlike, that Heretickes will reſpect the traditions or wrightings of men. Neither is it material, that Hereticks cauil againſt Scriptures, and detort them to contrarie ſences. For ſuch cauils and deprauations may eaſily be refuted by ſcriptures, and to ſuch abuſes the wrightings of men are much more ſubiect, then holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>But ſaith <hi>Kelliſon, <hi>The Deuill hath alwayes affected to be as like as may be, to Chriſt and his Apoſtles in allegation of Scripture.</hi>
                  </hi> He maketh alſo a long and lewd narration of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes alleadging Scriptures. But firſt moſt falſe it is, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil alwayes affecteth to alleadge Scriptures. Nay he alleadgeth traditions, cuſtomes and humane deuiſes more often then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Falſe it is alſo, that heretikes more often alleadge Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then the teſtimony of traditions, Fathers &amp; other reaſons. But ſuppoſe that heretikes ſhould often alleadge Scriptures; yet we are not to refuſe that, which by others is abuſed. Neither doe wiſe men refuſe meat, becauſe gluttons doe thereby ſurfet, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to drinke, for that drunkards abuſe wine to exceſſe. If then <hi>Kelliſon</hi> wil néeds folowe heretikes in calumniating ſcriptures, and not forbeare (as the deuil did) to abuſe Scriptures to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſence, then muſt he giue Chriſtians leaue to folowe <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles in alleadging Scriptures, and not preſume to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe, which prefer Scriptures before traditions, &amp; Gods worde before the Popes decretales.</p>

                  <hi>Pag. <hi>33.</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>34.</hi> He runneth out into a large field concerning the poſſeſſion of Scriptures, which (as he ſayth) <hi>belongeth to Catholikes, &amp; not to heretikes.</hi> But what may this make for Papiſts? whom by many reaſons we haue in our Challenge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced to be heretikes, and not Catholikes? Furthermore, the queſtion, which he propoſeth here, concerneth the ſufficiency and authority, and not the poſſeſſion of Scriptures. But this is this Surueyors pleaſure to abandon matters in Controuerſie, and to trifle about needleſſe queſtions.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:177778:20"/>
               <p>Afterward he ſheweth, why heretikes aledge Scriptures, and mentioneth the <hi>decrees &amp; writings of the Pope &amp; the Church.</hi> He endeuoreth alſo to prooue, <hi>that Scripture is not eaſily to be vnderſtood.</hi> Matters much ſtood vpon by him, but yet very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petinent in this place, where the queſtion is about allegation of Scriptures, as an Argument of it ſelfe only ſufficient. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, what if heretikes depraue and wreſt Scriptures, ſhal not true Catholikes rely vpon them? Thirdly the Popes bulles and blundering decretales are not of ſuch qualitye, that they ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to Scriptures: or mentioned, where they are in place. Laſtly, Scriptures in matters neceſſary to ſaluation, are playne and eaſy. But what if ſome places were difficult? ſhould we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſteine to alleadge Scriptures? nay rather we ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ſtudy them, that by vnderſtanding of them we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue our difficultyes. <hi>Tertullian</hi> alleadged by him <hi>pag. <hi>37.</hi>
                  </hi> doth not <hi>refuſe flatlye to diſpute with heretikes by Scripture,</hi> or count ſuch diſputation <hi>lippe labour,</hi> as this impudent compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion falſely affirmeth. For his common courſe was to conuince heretikes by Scriptures. But if he thought it fruteleſſe, at any time to alleadge Scriptures, it was againſt ſuch onely as denied the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Of holy Scriptures the prophane fellowe ſpeaketh, if not blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly, yet baſely and contemptibly. <hi>pag. <hi>35.</hi>
                  </hi> he compareth them to colours vſed by <hi>foule women,</hi> and to ſweete odours <hi>vſed by ſluttes. <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</hi> he calleth them <hi>bare,</hi> and compareth them to <hi>a noſe of waxe,</hi> and alloweth the ſaying of one, that compared them <hi>to Aeſops Fables,</hi> eſpecially vnderſtanding the bare letter of Scriptures. Finally, he ſhameth not <hi>pag. <hi>41.</hi>
                  </hi> to ſay, that <hi>the worde of God with a falſe meaning is the worde of the deuill.</hi> Matters deſeruing rather corporal puniſhment, then verbal cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. We may not therfore maruel, if he rayle at <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluin</hi> belying them without all ſhame or conſcience. <hi>Firſt</hi> he ſayth <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſſaloweth <hi>S.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177778:21"/> ſlaunders, and nothing doth <hi>K.</hi> bring to iuſtifie them. Laſtly he ſayth <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther <hi>will haue the bare letter, or joyned with their voluntary expoſition to be Iudge of controuerſies:</hi>
                  </hi> matters vtterly vntrue and improbable. For neither doe we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte the letter without the ſence, nor doe we allow voluntary or priuate expoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. <hi>46.</hi>
                  </hi> he falſifyeth the teſtimony of Scriptures, where he ſayth <hi>Her ſelfe confeſſeth her owne obſcurity.</hi> For <hi>S. Peter <hi>2. Epiſt. 3.</hi>
                  </hi> doth not ſay <hi>that the Scriptures are obſcure,</hi> as this <hi>K.</hi> pretendeth: but only <hi>that certaine thinges in <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Epiſtles are difficult.</hi> And <hi>pſal. <hi>119.</hi>
                  </hi> the Prophet compareth Gods word to <hi>a Lanterne,</hi> and <hi>to light. <hi>Lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum</hi>
                  </hi> ſayth he, <hi>&amp; lumen ſemitis meis.</hi> If any obſcuritie and difficultie be attributed to Scriptures by Fathers, it is only in ſuch poyntes, as are not neceſſary to ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Finally, he reciteth the words of <hi>Luther</hi> concerning the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Scriptures partially, and obiecteth vnto vs the teſtimony of <hi>Oſiander</hi> about the differences concerning mans iuſtification by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But neither is <hi>Luther</hi> to be blamed, if he reprooue thoſe, that call Scriptures obſcure: nor is any credite to be giuen to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> citing <hi>Oſiander,</hi> nor to <hi>Oſiander,</hi> where he writeth againſt thoſe that differ from him in the Article of mans iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Long may he declayme againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Oſiander</hi> and others. But nothing doth his reaſoning or rather rayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reading of Scriptures effect. For who will not rather fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the exhortation of <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> exhorting lay-men to get them Bibles, and to read Scriptures, then regarde the babling of this Popiſh paraſite, that calleth readers of ſcriptures <hi>Bibliſts,</hi> and ſayth we holde, <hi>that to be the true meaning of Scriptures, which euery ones priuate ſpirit imagineth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third chapter of his firſt book, he diſputeth againſt thoſe <hi>which make their owne priuate Spirit ſupreme iudge in earth of the interpretation of Scripture.</hi> The which as it lanceth the Pope deepely, whoſe priuate and ſatanical ſpirit is the ſupreame iudge, whome all Papiſts are bound to follow; ſo it toucheth not vs at all. For albeit wee refuſe the Pope and his adherents for iudges; yet we relye not vpon our owne priuate ſpirit in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding ſcriptures but vpon the ſpirit of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther ſpeaketh plainely, or expoundeth himſelfe in ſome other place, and for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177778:21"/> the right vnderſtanding of Scriptures, vſe the hope of tonges, the expoſition of fathers and all learned men, the diſcourſe of hiſtories, and all other good meanes. Neither did <hi>Luther</hi> thinke, or proceede otherwiſe. Why then doth noth this ſuperlu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticall Surueyor declare, who they bee, that doe attribute the publike and iudiciall interpretation of Scriptures <hi>to euery mans priuate ſpirit,</hi> and in what place? why doth he forge to himſelfe an abſurde opinion held by none, that I knowe, ſaue the Papiſts, who in matters controuerſed hold the Popes priuate definition, for a ſupreme reſolution? would hee therein ſhew his trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant eloquence? if this were his purpoſe; let vs ſee, I beſeech you, what he performeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith <hi>ſelfe loue is a good, as guilding,</hi> and then tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the <hi>goodmans Cowe, Pans pipe, Appolloes harpe, painting of womens faces, Hens and Chickens,</hi> and ſuch like fooleries. But his horrible eloquence declareth him to bee the Chicken of a Buzzard, and a blinde Harper, that cannot diſcerne betweene ſelfe loue, &amp; priuate ſpirits. His reader alſo may ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee hath as much ſkill in painting of faces, as in expounding of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And yet all his Cow eloquence wil not ſerue to couer the deformities of the painted whore of <hi>Babilon,</hi> of whome hee is a deuoute ſeruant, and vppon whome he beſtoweth much complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> regardeth it not, albeit ſome of the Fathers ſhould ſpeake againſt a point of faith: neither would hee ſubmitte his Doctrine to be iudged by the Romiſh antichriſtian prelates. But that ſheweth not, that he preferred himſelfe before any, but rather that hee preferred the Scriptures and articles of Chriſtian faith before all. And to them he exhorteth all to ſubmitte themſelues, aſcribing nothing to his owne opinion. But what if <hi>Luther</hi> ſhold haue ſpoken out of ſquare? what is that to <hi>the new Religion,</hi> he ſpeaketh off? doth our religion depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery word of <hi>Luther?</hi> certes no more, then the faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vpon the idle diſcourſes of <hi>Kelliſons</hi> Suruey. As for <hi>Caluin</hi> hee referreth nothing to his owne ſpirrit, but to the rule of Gods word, to which he ſubmitteth his interpretations, as well of theſe wordes, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> as of other places of Scriptures elſe where interpreted by him.</p>
               <p>Finally, we neither reiect Fathers, nor Councels, nor godlye
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177778:22"/> paſtors. The ſkip-iacke ſurueyor therefore, that calleth <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin Skip-iacks,</hi> and like a ſkip-iack running from matter to matter, makes ſo long a declamation againſt ſelfe loue, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-weening a mans ſelfe, did herein ſeeme to loue himſelfe, but too much, and much to offend in ouer-weening and ſurcuydrie, that pleaſed himſelfe in this Chapter, that is ſo farre from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſo falſe in reſpect of vs, and ſo contrarie to himſelfe, and his owne cauſe.</p>
               <p>His fourth Chapter he beginneth, as his manner is, with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall declamation againſt <hi>Parricides,</hi> ſhewing how ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were puniſhed, <hi>being ſowed into a ſacke with a Cocke, a Viper, an Ape, and a Dogge.</hi> But to what purpoſe is all this? doth he thinke, that it is no leſſe, then the crime of Parricide, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſome Fathers? why then, the Pope and his agents by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this <hi>K.</hi> are all parricides, and for their dogged and vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, apiſh, and cockiſh natures, deſerue to be ſewed in ſackes, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbane <hi>the ſixt</hi>
                  </hi> did deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certaine Cardinals, &amp; with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſtes of like nature to be throwne into the ſea. As for vs wee reiect no Fathers, that conſent one with another, and with holy ſcriptures in matters of faith, but rather the baſtardlye writinges of falſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of ſuch as take vppon them the names of Fathers, or elſe ſuch, as hold ſingular opinions, or varie from the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> had no reaſon in matter of the Sacrifice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Maſſe to diſclaime the fathers, which all with one voice, as I haue iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> make againſt the carnall ſacrifice of the Popiſh Maſſe for quicke and dead. But if hee or <hi>Caluin,</hi> or any other ſpeake againſt Fathers, it is not againſt all, nor againſt the Bookes, which are certainely knowne to bee theirs, but againſt counterfet fellowes, and ſome particuler opinions.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Caluin</hi> ſhould call the men of <hi>Trent, <hi>Hogges and Aſſes,</hi>
                  </hi> he did them a ſpeciall fauour. For they ſhewed themſelues to bée worſe, being open enemies of the Chriſtian faith, and moſte obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate oppugners of the truth. But they are none of our Fathers, nor of the Fathers of the Church. Nor is the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaining the abuſes, which we refuſe, our Mother, but <hi>the Mother of fornications,</hi> or as <hi>Petrarch</hi> calleth her, <hi>the Mother of errors,</hi> and the greate <hi>Whore</hi> deſcribed <hi>Apocalypſ. 17. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>
                  </hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt wanteth much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> learning of former Fathers; yet is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:177778:22"/> neither he, nor his meſſenger <hi>Auſten</hi> ſo bad, but that his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were farre worſe. Furthermore, we doe not beleeue, that ſo wiſe a man as <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt is reputed, would write ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Bookes, as the dialogues, that goe vnder his name, and are ſo full of olde wiues tales, and fabulous toyes.</p>
               <p>But ſhould <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> or others ouerlaſh in ſpeaking of Fathers; yet to doe this <hi>K.</hi> fauour, I am content to ioyne with him vpon this iſſue, that the Fathers of the Church in their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical writinges in the greateſt controuerſies betwixt vs and the Papiſtes are for vs and againſt them. And of this hee could not be ignorant, but that he is onely a Schoole pedant, and an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant broacher of new opinions, and not verſed in the writings of the Fathers. Againſt vs he alleageth the moſt reuerend &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Father <hi>Toby Matthew</hi> moſt worthy Biſhop of <hi>Durham:</hi> but he doth offer him ſinguler wrong, as that reuerend Biſhop will alwaies teſtifie. Afterward he bringeth in <hi>Genebrard</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemy, whoſe depoſition is no more worth, then if this ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhould out of his malice ſpeake it. <hi>Luthers</hi> ſcruples grew not vpon doubt of the Fathers doctrine, but of the long approbation of the Maſſe, and other abuſes. In fréewill for ſubſtance of doctrine we doubt not of the Fathers fauour againſt the Papiſtes.</p>
               <p>Finally he ſayth, <hi>The Fathers haue the infallible aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit in expoſition of Scriptures,</hi> and that thoſe which reiect them, <hi>reiect alſo the councels of the Church,</hi> and the <hi>authority of Paſtors,</hi> by which the Church is directed: And finallye <hi>open a gate to all Hereſies.</hi> But heere are manye abſurdities hoodled together without truth or order. For <hi>Firſt</hi> he ſuppoſeth moſt falſely, that all the Fathers are reiected by vs. <hi>Secondly</hi> he confirmeth the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Fathers to be equal to the determination of the Pope, which neither his holy Father, nor his owne conſortes will graunt. <hi>Thirdly</hi> not euerie one that reiecteth Fathers in ſome things, dooth therefore reiect coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels or all the paſtors of the Church. <hi>Finally</hi> albeit diuers late Councels were reiected, and the teſtimonies of fathers not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without choiſe; yet the definitions of Councels, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently deduced out of Scriptures, and the Fathers authentical expoſitions, conſonant to the rule of faith might bee approued by thoſe, which haue authoritie in the Church, which euerie priuate man is to followe, vnleſſe by ſome equall, or greater authoritie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:177778:23"/> that reſolution be reuerſed. But if <hi>Kelliſons</hi> Doctrine were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; then might the Pope goe ſhake his eares. For what ſhold we need to goe to him, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers haue Gods holy ſpirit infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aſſiſting them in the expoſition of Scriptures? againe if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the authoritie of Fathers were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opening of a gap to all Hereſies, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did the Popes open gaps to al Hereſies, who in their decretaline expoſitions of <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> &amp; <hi>feede my Sheep, and drinke ye all of this,</hi> and infinit ſuch like textes of ſcriptures decline quite from the common interpretation of Fathers, and nothing regard their authoritie.</p>
               <p>The fift Chapter is partly a Scholaſtical exerciſe concerning <hi>the motiues, that may enduce men to beleeue the Chriſtian fayth,</hi> and partly an inuectiue againſt vs, for that we admit not the rinegued Maſſe-prieſtes ſent vs hither by the Pope, &amp; their counterfet miracles. And thereupon he would conclude, that we want thoſe probable meanes to enduce reaſonable men to be of our religion, which the Papiſts haue. But firſt his diſpute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning probable motiues to the fayth, is nothing elſe, but a vaine diſcourſe of his owne fooliſh motions, diſioynted opinions, and improbable fancyes. For not onely the <hi>Pagans</hi> of olde time, but alſo the <hi>Turkes</hi> now may better alleage <hi>antiquity, conſent, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of miſſion, the ſubduing of the worlde to their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, miracles and ſuch like motiues,</hi> then the Papiſtes, ſéeing Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is nothing elſe, but a corruption of Chriſtian religion, that is neither ſo auncient, as <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> nor ſo largely ſpread abroad as <hi>Paganiſme</hi> and <hi>Turciſme.</hi> Neither are the Papiſtes for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comparable to the auncient Philoſophers. <hi>Secondly</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer this <hi>K.</hi> ſpeaketh of miſſion, it maketh againſt the Maſſe-prieſtes, that come both without authority, and without any meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage deliuered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Apoſtles vnto them. For neuer ſhal he prooue the Popes vſurped authority, though he ſhould liue to the worldes end, nor that Maſſe-prieſts are to ſacifice for quick and dead, and to cut the throat of Princes, which be the principal poyntes of their miſſion. <hi>Thirdly</hi> we offer to prooue, that we haue not onely thoſe probable motiues, which he ſpeaketh of, <hi>as miracles, conſent, antiquity,</hi> and ſuch like, to enduce men to like of our religion; but alſo the worde of God, the teſtimony of the auncient apoſtolike Church, and many ſure groundes, which our aduerſaryes want. Neither néeded this <hi>K.</hi> to brag much of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:177778:23"/> or <hi>Suarez,</hi> ſeeing their poſitions ſtand refuted without anſwer, but that he which can ſay little him ſelfe, muſt néeds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye on others. <hi>Fourthly</hi> nothing hath this babler to obiect either againſt the authoritye of our teachers, or their doctrine; which is not more vnſauery, then Colewortes twice or thrice ſodden. Where he calleth Boy Maſſe-prieſtes <hi>olde teachers,</hi> and their doctrine alſo <hi>olde,</hi> and our teachers and doctrine <hi>newe;</hi> he like a poore diſputer beggeth that, which he cannot by argument effecte or conuince, and like a fooliſh pleader, talketh of matters preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to him ſelfe. Nay, when he ſhall come to tryall, he ſhall find, that the Fathers in all poyntes of fayth are for vs, and not for the Pope, whoſe triple-Crowneſhip, and decretaline doctrine they neuer knewe. <hi>Fiftly</hi> where he (like a curre) barketh at the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the renowned Father <hi>Biſhop Iewel,</hi> and ſnarleth at the moſt famous learned man the Lord <hi>of Pleſſis Marlj,</hi> as if they had corrupted and miſ-alledged Scriptures and Fathers, and by vntruthes and weake proofes abuſed they readers; the firſt is iuſtified by maiſter <hi>Whitakers</hi> againſt al the barkings of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enimies: the ſecond hath verified his allegations againſt al his accuſers, by the original words of the authors by him alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in a late edition of his booke, &amp; both theſe verifications ſtand without reply. But if we ſhould goe about to collect all the lyes, ſlaunders, impoſtures, corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, falſifications, errors, fooleries, fond concluſions, abſurd aſſertions without ground, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Suarez, Harding, Saunders, Alan, Stapleton</hi> and their mates; they would fill Cart-loades of volumes. Finally all this long diſcourſe is as farre from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>Kelliſon</hi> is farre from learning and honeſty. For heere hee ſhould reaſon againſt the grounds of our Religion. But groundes are one thing, and motiues another: thoſe being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, theſe probable, and oftentimes not concludent. But were hee not a beetle-headed Surueyor, as he is a polſhorne ſacrificer of <hi>Baal;</hi> he would haue forborne to touch this poynt of motiues. For what motiue can any man haue to beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an vnlearned, bougerly, blinde and wicked Pope is ſupreme iudge of Religion, that an obſcure and infamous <hi>Italian</hi> hath power to depoſe the King of <hi>England;</hi> that Chriſtians are not to beleeue the articles of our chriſtian faith, nor Scriptures, vnleſſe they receiue them from the Popes chayre; that Eccleſiaſticall traditions, of which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:177778:24"/> the authours and defenders are not yet reſolued, are equall to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, that the olde lattin vulgar tranſlation of the Bible is authenticall, and the originall text not, or that Dogges do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time eate <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body, or that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body and blood is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in the Maſſe, although the ſame at the ſame inſtant be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and is not conſumed, as is the manner of ſacrifices; and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſuch abſurdities?</p>
               <p>In the end of the firſt Chapter hee citeth diuers ſlaundrous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> and talketh Idely of the good life of Papiſts, or rather excuſeth their lewd life notorious to the world. He doth alſo alleage the number, antiquity, miracles, and other qualityes of ſuch as taught his religion. Afterward he runneth backe to talke of the ſucceſſion of Popes. Finally by a tale out of <hi>Ioſephus</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> Temple he douteth not, but he ſhould winne the victory, if he were to plead againſt vs. But if he plead no more wiſely, then he doth in this place; his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorye ſhould haue good reaſon to hiſſe him from the barre. For firſt his ſlanderous reportes againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters deuiſed by <hi>Cochleus, Staphilus, Bolſecus,</hi> and other popiſh paraſites hired of purpoſe to deuiſe ſlanders againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: of which <hi>Bolſecus</hi> in publike ſynode reuoked his malicious libell. But the matters we obiect to the Popes, and their adherents, are matters recorded in publik actes &amp; authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical hiſtories, the authors wherof were men fauouring popery. <hi>Secondly</hi> this Lobſter-faced fellow would bluſh to talk of the liues of the <hi>Italians</hi> and other the popes adherents, but that he knoweth their lewde actes are concealed from the people of <hi>England</hi> by the remoteneſſe and diſtance of their Country. And yet all that know <hi>Italy,</hi> and the nations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Pope, will ſay, he hath no reaſon to ſtand much vpon their pietye or honeſtye. <hi>Thirdly</hi> neuer ſhall he ſhewe, eyther that the moderne Popes are the ſucceſſors of the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that the Popiſh Biſhops, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marked ſlaues of Antichriſt, are the true ſucceſſors of <hi>Auſten</hi> the Monke and his fellowes. Nay the Doctrine that wee profeſſe, being taught by them, and the decretaline doctrine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we refuſe, being vnknowne to them, it muſt needes followe, that not the popiſh Wolues, but our Biſhops are their ſucceſſors, Finally the tale out of <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> doth little fit this <hi>K.</hi> purpoſe. For neither hath the moderne Church of <hi>Rome</hi> any affinitie with the temple of the Iewes, nor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177778:24"/> can this <hi>K.</hi> doe any ſuch feates as he imagineth.</p>
               <p>Was not then this ſurueyor both idle, and vnaduiſed, that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through ſo many impertinent matters to his particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſo aduerſe to his generall cauſe?</p>
               <p>The laſt Chapter of his firſt book is yet more extrauaga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt. For therin he ſpeaketh not one word of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of our Religion, which are the things which he propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the ſubiect of his diſcourſe; but of the Pope, whome wee take to bee the head of Antichriſtes Kingdome, and to bee ſo rightlye called, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee would gladlye prooue him to bee the ſupreme iudge in matters of Religion. And his reaſon is, for <hi>that euery King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath his King, euerie Dukedome a Duke, euerie Cittie a Major or Bayliffe, euery Army a general, euerie village almoſt hath a Conſtable, &amp;c.</hi> hee prooueth the ſame alſo by Gods order both before the Law and after, and by the example of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, as he ſaith, were euer called the <hi>Vicars of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſors of S. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </hi> And in the end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing runne himſelfe out of breath, he concludeth, that we haue no iudge in matters of Religion, and ſo open a gap to all Hereſies. But if he come into his Countrie and reaſon no better, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the parriſh where he landeth, if hee bee a man of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, may doe well to ſet him by the heeles. For <hi>Firſt</hi> hee reaſoneth abſurdly from politick bodies to <hi>Chriſtes</hi> myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>Secondly</hi> if any argument might bee drawne from thence; yet would this ſimilitude ouerthrowe the Popes monarchy. For albeit, euerie Kingdome, Armie, Cittie and Village hath his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour; yet it were abſurd to make one King ouer all the world, one commander ouer all armies, one grand Maior or Conſtable ouer all the Maiors and Conſtables of the world. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there one ſupreme iudge of matters of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lawe, vnder the lawe, or in the time of the Goſpell, as I haue at large prooued againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in my Bookes <hi>De po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> (which are to hot for ſuch a tender fingred Surueyor to handle) nor are we now to conforme our ſelues to the law, but to Chriſtes inſtitution. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> for one thouſand yeares after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall not this ranging fellow prooue, that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were called <hi>Chriſts Vicars.</hi> The title of <hi>Peters <hi>ſucceſſors</hi>
                  </hi> is common to all true teachers ſucceeding <hi>Peter,</hi> and importeth no generall commaund ouer the whole Church. <hi>Fiftlye, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:177778:25"/> Biſhop of <hi>Antioche <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. Autolicum</hi> is groſſely belyed. So like wiſe is <hi>Chryſoſtome <hi>homil.</hi> 34. in <hi>epiſt.</hi> 1. ad <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, he wrongeth vs, where he ſaith <hi>we haue no judge of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion.</hi> For the onely ſupreme iudge that determineth infallibly is God ſpeaking in Scriptures. If any varietie bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his determination, the ſupreme iudge of all the church vpon earth is a lawfull generall councell proceeding according to Gods word. In the meane while euerie nation is to ſtand to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a nationall councel. And to this iudge doe we ſubmit our ſelues. As for the Papiſts they ſubmitte themſelues to a blinde Pope, that ſometime beleeueth not, and ſeldome vnderſtandeth the Articles of the Chriſtian faith. <hi>Kelliſon</hi> therefore, that drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of ſuch a fellowes infallible iudgement, hath little reaſon to talke againſt the proceeding vſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for deciding of matters of Religion. Further hee hath neede to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that the Conſtable of one parriſh or other, take him not within the ſphere of his actiuitie, leaſt he place him in the ſupreme hole of the Stocks, for his ſupreme idiotiſme in matters of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning religion.</p>

                  </gap>nely a meere foolery, and moſt groſſe impietye, but alſo an
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:177778:25"/> open way to all ſuperſtition and Hereſie. The ſame ground is alſo ouerthrowne by <hi>Kelliſons</hi> owne poſitions. Meere foolery it is to build our faith vpon a blind ignorant and wicked Pope. Neither can wee eſteeme it other then impietie to adde a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that, which is already laide, which is <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and to beleeue the Popes determinations, as the word of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this being graunted, then will it followe, the Pope teaching Hereſie, that all Papiſts are to followe him, and that when he goeth to hell for teaching errors, according to the Chapter <hi>ſi papa. diſt. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </hi> that <hi>Kelliſon</hi> and his conſorts are to goe after him. <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſuppoſeth, that he cannot erre. But this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that his faith is built vppon ſuppoſals, yea ſuch ſuppoſals as by euident demonſtrations are declared to be falſe.</p>
               <p>Finally this ground of the miſſion of the Popes, and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Maſſe-prieſtes is ouerthrowne by <hi>Kelliſon</hi> his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For if the Popes bee not <hi>S. Peters</hi> or the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Romes</hi> ſucceſſors; then are they, as <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſaith, intruders and falſe Prophets, nay theeues and Robbers.</p>
               <p>But Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors they cannot be, hauing <hi>Firſt</hi> no vocation to be Apoſtles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> taking on them an Office that <hi>S. Peter</hi> neuer had, to wit, to mannage both the ſwords, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of kingdomes, to cut chriſtian mens throates, that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their marke, and leauing <hi>S. Peters</hi> office in feeding <hi>Chriſtes</hi> ſhéepe.</p>
               <p>Neither are they the lawful ſucceſſors of the firſt Biſhops. For firſt they are no Biſhops, as neither hauing lawfull election by the people and Clergie, but onely by certaine new vpſtart electors called Cardinals, nor preaching or dooing the worke of a Biſhop. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they haue deuiſed a new Doctrine and faith, diuers from that, which the firſt biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> taught, as their decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales ſhew. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they haue taken vppon them an vniuerſall power both in temporall and eccleſiaſticall matters, which the Chriſtian Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in times paſt neuer had nor challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>The Maſſe-prieſts conſequently being authorized by the Pope cannot pretend any lawfull calling or miſſion. But were they cleare of this exception, yet can they not iuſtifie their miſſion. For <hi>firſt</hi> they are called <hi>ad ſacrificandum pro viuis et defunctis,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is <hi>to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for quicke and dead.</hi> But of ſuch a calling there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177778:26"/> ground nor memoriall in the holy ſcriptures, or auncient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Secondly,</hi> they teach not the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſors, but of the Popes decretales, and of the Schools Sophiſters. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> they are the market ſlaues of Antichriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their crownes ſhauen, and their handes annointed with his oyle, and with him they fight againſt the Saints of God. Of their abhominable villanies, I will ſay nothing at this time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue iuſt occaſion being prouoked thereto by the vniuſt ſlaunders of this greaſie Maſſe-prieſt againſt maiſter <hi>Luther</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi> of reuerend memorie. That part of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhall be reſerued to a greater volume.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this <hi>K.</hi> excludeth ſcriptures from being a foundation of religion. Wherin he hath great reaſon if we reſpect the doctrine of Papiſts. For how can they admit ſcriptures for a foundation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rayle againſt them, flye from them, and cannot ſtand, if their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie were moſt eminent, and to bee preferred before all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine deuiſes? but this ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Kelliſon</hi> is a better Maſon to build <hi>Babell,</hi> and the ſynagogue of ſatan, which is vpholden with humane traditions and the Popes ſword, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of God, which is built vppon the Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cheefe corner ſtone.</p>
               <p>His third foundation, as it ſeemeth, is laid vpon Councels and Fathers. For of them hee talketh much <hi>Lib. <hi>1.</hi> C. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> but neither doth he name what Councels, nor what Fathers, nor what wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Fathers he meaneth: matters of verie important conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For foundations muſt be certaine. But among the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels actes, and writings of Fathers, there are many thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eſtabliſhed by councels, nor taught by Fathers. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the Fathers themſelues will not haue their writings taken for canonicall, or authenticall ſcriptures, as may bee prooued by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite teſtimonies. But I will heere onelye alleadge one or two. <hi>Quamuis ſanctus ſit aliquis poſt apoſtolos</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi> in <hi>Pſal. <hi>86.</hi> quamuis diſertus ſit, non habet authoritatem.</hi> He ſaith plainely, <hi>that no Father after the Apoſtles time hath authoritie.</hi> The ſame Father ſheweth, that onely Scriptures are the foundation of the Church: and <hi>Auguſtine <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Contr.</hi> Creſcon. <hi>c.</hi> 31.</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>literas <hi>Cypriani,</hi> non vt canonicat habeo.</hi> The like he ſaith <hi>epiſt. <hi>19.</hi> ad. Hieronymum,</hi> and <hi>epiſt. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </hi> ſhewing <hi>that there is great difference betwixt ſcriptures, and the writings of Fathers.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:177778:26"/> diuers Heretikes haue pretended councels and Fathers.</p>
               <p>His laſt and moſte authenticall foundation is the ſupreme iudgement of the Pope. But that ſheweth, that popiſh religion is rather from man, then God, and that the Papiſts are rather the ſynagogue of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> relying vppon his decretales, then the church of God, that is built vpon alſo plainelye declare, that there is no certainty in popiſh Religion, ſtanding vppon the humor of a man, whoſe opinions are repugnant to other popes, and whoſe minde may change, and cauſe him to vtter contrarie Doctrines. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it ſheweth, that Popiſh Religion is abſurd, being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the opinions and ſentences of ignorant &amp; impious men. <hi>Finally,</hi> grant this, &amp; then the Papiſts, if the Pope deny <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt all goe to hell with him.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe <hi>Stapleton</hi> handling of purpoſe this argument in the preface of his booke of Doctrinall principles, deliuereth vnto vs theſe ſeauen principles and foundations of faith, Firſt <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Apoſtolike Church,</hi> Secondly, <hi>the power of the ſame church in teaching and iudging matters of faith infallibly,</hi> Thirdlye, <hi>the perſons, in whome this power doth reſide.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the meanes by which they proceede in teaching &amp; judging.</hi> Fiftly, <hi>the chiefe heads, about which that power is conuerſant.</hi> Sixtly, <hi>authoritie to interpret Scriptures infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> and laſtly, <hi>power to deliuer Doctrines not conteined in Scriptures.</hi> But if he had beene bound in ſtatute ſtaple, I doe not thinke he could haue ſpoken more abſurdly, or impiouſly, &amp; falſlye. For <hi>Firſt</hi> if hee talke of principles demonſtratiue of the chriſtian faith, then ſhould he not haue talked of ſingle words, and termes, as he doth, but of propoſitions or Scriptures conteining the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marye propoſitions of the Chriſtian faith. <hi>Secondly</hi> if the rude fellow had but had one graine of pietie, he would not haue left out the holy Scriptures out of the number of chriſtian principles. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Church, to ſpeake properlye, is built vpon a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is not the foundation of the Church, vnleſſe he will haue both a building without a foundation, and a foundation beſide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> building. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> it is an abſurd courſe to ſeparate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of the Church, and the perſons in whome the ſame conſiſteth, from the Church. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> what more ridiculous, then to call a forme of proceeding, a principle of Chriſtian Doctrine? <hi>Sixtly,</hi> all Articles
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177778:27"/> of the faith may be called heads, but it is meere foppery to thinke that Chriſtian Religion hath as many foundations, as ſeuerall Articles. Finally it is moſte abſurde to beleeue, that eyther the Pope, or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth interpret ſcriptures infallibly, or hath the power to adde Articles not contained in Scriptures to the Chriſtian faith. If then <hi>Stapletons</hi> meaning be, that all tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not written, and all interpretations of the Pope and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, and all the Popes determinations and decretales, and the ſayings of the fathers and Councels allowed by the Pope are the foundations of faith, then doth he endeuor to build <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> fantaſticall deuiſes, and monſtrous chimeraes, and not the true faith; the kingdome of Antichriſt, and not Chriſtes church. Nay if theſe were foundations of faith; then would it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the foundation of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith is not yet fully laide. For as yet all their decretales, and determinations are not fully publiſhed. <hi>Secondly</hi> we ſhould not know where to finde this faith, theſe traditions, and interpretations and opinions of Fathers, all of them being not yet reſolued. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith ſhould be a meere humane deuiſe ſtanding vpon humane fancies. <hi>Finally</hi> it ſhould be contrary to it ſelfe, and to ſcriptures: for ſuch are the <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions and interpretations and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus</hi> in his Booke <hi>de Locis Theologicis,</hi> layeth downe ten groundes, from whence all arguments in controuerſies of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in his opinion are deriued. The <hi>firſt</hi> is <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> The <hi>2. traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> The <hi>3. is the authoritie of the Catholik church</hi> The <hi>4. is the authority of general councels.</hi> The <hi>5. is the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </hi> The <hi>6. is the authoritie of the holy Fathers.</hi> The <hi>7.</hi> is <hi>the authoritie of Schoolemen &amp; Canoniſts.</hi> The <hi>8.</hi> is <hi>naturall reaſon.</hi> The <hi>9.</hi> is <hi>the authoritie of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and ciuill lawyers.</hi> The laſt is <hi>the authoritie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane hiſtories.</hi> But firſt it is no ſmal wrong to ioyne with holy ſcriptures, not onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writing of Fathers, but alſo the writings of Schoolemen, canoniſts, and profane writers. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is the ouerthrowe of faith, to found the ſame vppon vncertaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne traditions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it appeareth heereby, that the faith of Papiſts for the moſte part is an humane opinion being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon men, nay vpon humane reaſon. <hi>Finally,</hi> his groundes are not onely changeable for the moſte part, but alſo contrarie one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177778:27"/> to another. That is prooued, not onely by the mutability of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of councels, &amp; Doctrine of councels, Schoole-diuines, Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and prophane authors, but alſo by traditions themſelues, of which diuers are abrogated and ceaſed. This may be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by traditions, by teſtimonies of Fathers, actes of Councels, the doctrine of <hi>Thomiſtes</hi> and <hi>Scotiſtes,</hi> Canoniſts, ciuill Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and profane writers. For not onely profane writers haue ſhewed themſelues ignorant of matters of faith, but both Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and fathers haue held contrarie opinions, as ſhall be prooued when neede is by diuers particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his <hi>Preface <hi>in lib. de pont. Rom.</hi>
                  </hi> is not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to apply theſe words of the Prophet <hi>Iſay, <hi>Behold I will put a Stone in the foundation of</hi> Sion:</hi> vnto the pope. There alſo hee auoucheth <hi>the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee the foundation of the Faith.</hi> Likewiſe in the end of his preface <hi>de verbo dei,</hi> he ſeemeth to holde that the ſence of Scriptures is to be fetched from the Popes See, and ſenceleſſe decretales. Laſtly the ſame man doth as confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleadge the Pope decretales, as Saint <hi>Paules <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in the Chapter <hi>Sancta. diſt. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </hi> ordeineth, <hi>that the Hiſtories of Martyrs and their ſufferings are to bee receiued.</hi> And commonly the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church doth prooue her traditions partly out of ſuch legends, and partly out of their miſſals, porte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other rituall Bookes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kelliſon</hi> therefore, when he looketh vpon the ruinous founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> faith, hath little reaſon to talke againſt the foundations of our Chriſtian faith. For <hi>Firſt</hi> we all agree, that the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles are the principles and foundations of our faith: and thus both Scriptures, and Fathers doe teach vs. But the Papiſts, as may appeare by that, which I haue alleadged, doe one differ from another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus</hi> doth not once mention the Pope among his theologicall places: which to <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is the principall fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the worke. Contrarywiſe <hi>Stapleton</hi> leaueth Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures out of his reckoning of principles of faith, which <hi>Canus</hi> confeſſeth to be a moſte ſolide foundation of faith. <hi>Canus</hi> againe numbreth diuers foundations, and places theologicall, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe not once mention.</p>
               <p>Secondly albeit we doe not build our faith principallye, eyther vpon the actes of councels, or teſtimonies of Fathers, further
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177778:28"/> then they build their Doctrine vpon holy Scriptures, yet in the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Scriptures wee doe not neglect the authoritie of councels and Fathers. But the Papiſts, albeit they ſeeme to found their faith vpon the authoritie of councels, and Fathers, yet regard them not one ſtraw, if it be the popes pleaſure to determine contrarie vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> our faith is built vpon the rocke <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> but the faith of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> is built vppon the ſtraw and ſtubble of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh traditions &amp; determinations, and as they ſay; vpon the Pope, who to them is the ſupreme iudge, and pole-ſtarre of faith ſhining out of his papall Chaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> our faith is the Chriſtian faith, being built onely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God. Theirs is a decretaline, &amp; an humane faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built vpon the Popes decretales, and humane inuentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> our groundes are immoouable, and agree well one with an other. But their groundes are mutable, and contrary one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> they cannot deny our groundes, vnleſſe they will blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme againſt holy Scriptures. But vpon their owne groundes they are not yet well agreed. We doe generally refuſe them, and antiquity was ignorant of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuenthly,</hi> our groundes are ſafe and ſure. But he that folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Pope, or beleeueth all that is written in the Breuiaryes and Miſſals, cannot aſſure him felfe, that he is in the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> it is a thing moſt ridiculous to beleeue, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer an vnlearned Pope, or a man voyd of religion determineth in matters of fayth, is to be holden as a matter and firme Article of fayth. For as well may a blind man iudge of colours, as a blind and irreligious Pope of matters of religion. But we are aſſured, that the Prophets and Apoſtles haue truly declared vnto vs the whole counſaile of God.</p>
               <p>Open your eyes therfore deere Chriſtians, and ſuffer not your ſelues to be abuſed by the impoſtures of Maſſe-prieſtes. You ſee they are not reſolued in the foundations of fayth. And doe you think that theſe men entend the edification of Gods Church, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Elliſon</hi> in his firſt Booke and fift Chapter, talketh of Motiues to Chriſtian religion: but ſo coldely and barely, as if his cauſe wanted life and motion. <hi>Firſt,</hi> he telleth vs <hi>pag. <hi>106.</hi>
                  </hi> that our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his Miſſion by prophecyes and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Among other miracles hee talketh of the ſtrange co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt, which the Apoſtles made of Idolatry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he ſayth <hi>we want reaſon and authoritye to perſwade men to our religion, being not comparable eyther to auncient Fathers, or to <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Suarez,</hi>
                  </hi> and ſuch fellowes, <hi>in wit, or learning, or good life, or antiquity, or number, or dignity. Thirdly,</hi> he talketh of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; ſucceſſion.</hi> But <hi>Firſt</hi> the example of our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; the conqueſt made by <hi>Chriſts</hi> Apoſtles ouer Idolatrye maketh againſt the idolatrous papiſts. For neither can the Pope prooue his vniuerſall Monarchy by Prophets, or by miracles; nor hath any Chriſtian man reaſon to adhere to papiſtes, that want confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of their Popes, and Maſſe-prieſtes Miſſion, and yet bring into their Churches heatheniſh idolatry, and much falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious doctrine, and namely concerning the <hi>7.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ancient Fathers are wholy againſt the papiſtes in theſe poynts. As for the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their paraſites <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Suarez,</hi> and the reſt, they are not ſuch, as are to be bragged vpon, eyther for learning, wit, good life, or any vertue.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:177778:29"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> neither are the papiſtes comparable in number to the <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, nor haue they eyther true ſucceſſion, or conſent, or antiquity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh for them. Nay if the papiſtes would ſtand to theſe motiues; they were cleerly gone. For neither haue they propheſies or miracles for them, Nor can the Pope, or the Maſſe-prieſts prooue their miſſion by miracles, nor doth antiquity make for them. As for good life, this <hi>K.</hi> may be much aſhamed to ſpeake of it, the filthynes of Popes, Cardinals, Maſſe-prieſtes, Monkes, Nonnes and Friars, being ſo notorious to the worlde, and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ſo many ſtoryes and actes of Councels.</p>
               <p>What then is the reaſon, that ſo many adhere to papiſtes, and what are the motiues, that enduce ſo many to like their religion? Forſooth firſt <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Sword.</hi> For they kill all, that will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Popes marke, or that once mutter againſt their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſecret and trecherous practiſes againſt all that ſhall once dare to profeſſe the truth. Maſſe-prieſtes brewe treaſon and rebellion, Ieſuites ſet on aſſaſſinors. The Pope hath his Agents with all Princes. Neither doth he, or his Agents omit any occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſtirre vp Princes to make warre againſt them that profeſſe the truth, and to perſecute them to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating, and killing, and poyſoning of Kings oppoſite to the Popes tyranny. By the Popes practice K. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> and Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were often in danger here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> By the trechery of the Leaguers King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> was ſlayne, and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4.</hi> wounded and brought to great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>France. <hi>Henry</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>Lucemburgh</hi> was poyſoned by a <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican</hi> Fryar. <hi>Frederic</hi> the <hi>2.</hi> was empoyſoned, and in the end murdered, as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> doth ſignifie: and this no dout by the Popes practiſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>5.</hi> of <hi>Nouember <hi>anno</hi> 1605.</hi> a trayne of gunpowder was layd by certaine Papiſtes vnder the vpper houſe of Parliament, purpoſing to deſtroy the King, the Quéene, the Prince, the nobles and commons there aſſembled; and by their deſtruction to replant popery in <hi>England</hi> The treaſon diſcouered, they broke forth into open rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> ſlaundrous Libels; as the inuectiues of <hi>Alan</hi> and <hi>Parſons</hi> againſt Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the State: of <hi>Saunders</hi> againſt Her, and her Parents and Counſaile: of the Leaguers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177778:29"/> and Ieſuites againſt <hi>King Henry the 3.</hi> and <hi>4.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the rayling diſcourſes written againſt <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Caluin, Beza, Knox,</hi> and all godly men declare.</p>

               <p>Finally, by our aduerſaryes diſcourſe and by their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, they may alſo plainely be conuinced to be Hereticks.

                  </hi> He might alſo haue added, <hi>teaching Doctrines of Deuils,</hi> and <hi>forbidding to marry,</hi> and commaunding to <hi>abſtaine from certaine meates,</hi> and then the matter would haue beene very cleare.

They doe alſo reſtreine their Monkes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eating fleſh, &amp; forbid lay-men to eate it vpon certaine daies. But albeit, he hath concealed theſe wordes from vs, yet hath he ſaid ſufficient. For teaching a new faith neuer knowne to the Apoſtles, nor taught by them, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are clearely gon from the faith: and hauing receiued a newe head of their Church, and new foundations of their Doctrine, and ſtrange formes of ſacraments, they are cloſelye departed out of the Catholike church, &amp; imbrace the particuler faith of the Pope. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can this their departing be denyed or concealed, for as <hi>Arius</hi> by denying of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> diuinitie and equalitie with the Father,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177778:32"/> and <hi>Neſtorius</hi> for making two perſons of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and other Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes for teaching ſingular pointes of Doctrine contrarie to the doctrine of the Apoſtles were ſaid to depart out of the Church, and ſo to abandon the ſocietie of the faithfull, although they might pretend ſucceſſion, and ſtill claymed the title of the Church, and of Catholikes; ſo the papiſts, if they teach any new Article of faith, not taught by the Apoſtles and auncient Church, they are depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Apoſtolike and Catholike church.</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſaith, <hi>that later ſtanding and noueltie is a marke of Hereticks.</hi> And this hee goeth about to proue by Scriptures, and Fathers. But he might well haue ſpared his labour, for wee doe not deny it. Nay vpon this ground we profeſſe, that wee are able manifeſtly to demonſtrate the Papiſts to be Heretickes. For ſuch a ſocietie as the Pope and his adherents are, was neuer ſéene for a long time after the Apoſtles. If <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſay contrarie; let him leaue his peda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tery, &amp; ſhew his triple-crowned Pope with two ſwords treading vpon Princes neckes and cutting their throates and ruling the world, his purple Cardinals, his ſhauen Maſſe-prieſtes, his Monckes, Nonnes and Fryars, and their retinue to haue continued ſince the Apoſtles times. Furthermore the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the carnal eating of Chriſtes fleſh, of tranſubſtantiation, of the ſubſiſtence of accidents in the euchariſt without their ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>If <hi>Kelliſon</hi> can deriue theſe Doctrines from the Apoſtles, his holy Father will giue him his bleſſing: if not, by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion his owne conſortes are to be anathematized as Heretikes, and the Pope for the head of them.</p>

               <p>In his fourth chapter he maketh it a propertie of Heretickes <hi>to renew old Hereſies.</hi> Which although it be not incident to all Heretickes; yet it is a verie eminent qualitie in the papiſts. For from the <hi>Simonians</hi> they haue borowed their practiſe of buying and ſelling eccleſiaſticall matters, and the vſe of Concubines; from the <hi>Carpocratians</hi> they haue taken the worſhip of images; from the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the ſaying of Maſſe, or offering their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Cakes in honour of our Lady; from the <hi>Marcioniſtes</hi> the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Chriſtians by women, and their <hi>limbus patrum;</hi> from the <hi>Valentinians</hi> &amp; <hi>Manicheies</hi> their opinion of the being of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body in the Sacrament without ſoliditie; from the <hi>Pelagians</hi> the denyall of originall ſinne in the bleſſed virgin, the perfection of iuſtice, and impeccabilitie of Chriſtians. Finally they haue deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued diuers other branches of old condemned Hereſies from other Heretickes, as at large I haue ſhewed in my late challenge.</p>
               <p>His fift marke of an Hereticke <hi>is want of ſucceſſion.</hi> A ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple marke, if wee doe well conſider it. For neither in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, nor in the time of <hi>Aaron,</hi> was there anye ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of knowne prieſtes in the world. Likewiſe neither our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>Peter</hi> did ſucceede the prieſtes of the Lawe. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> was by <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſigned an Apoſtle, hauing none to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. But to confeſſe ſucceſſion to bee a marke of the Church, and want of ſucceſſion a marke of an Hereticke; yet would this one property of Heretickes much blemiſh the <hi>Romiſh</hi> See. For neither are the Popes Biſhops, or <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, nor can the Papiſts deriue their Doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popes vniuerſall power, of his two ſwords, of his eſpouſals w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the church, of his indulgences, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carnal eating &amp; champing Chriſts fleſh with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> téeth, of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion vnder one kinde, of adoring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament and the Croſſe with diuine worſhip, of making vowes, confeſſions and prayers, to Saintes, and ſuch like pointes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaline Doctrine from the Apoſtles, or any Apoſtolike men, which, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſheweth, is a neceſſarie point in ſucceſſion.

Nay that rotten ſucceſſion of Popes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the cauſe of Papiſts, doth hang as vpon a thrid of a Spider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>web, hath no other ground and certainty, then the teſtimonie of <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Popes blinde bibliothecary, <hi>Martin Polonus, Platina, Sanders, Genebrard, Illeſca</hi> and ſuch like baſe fellows which no Chriſtian, I trow, wil admit for the <hi>Baſis,</hi> and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his faith.</p>
               <p>His ſixt marke of heretikes is <hi>diſſenſion in Doctrine.</hi> and this he prooueth in a long and tedious diſcourſe. But with this mark he brandeth his owne conſortes for Heretikes. For they diſſent, not onely from the auncient Fathers. But one from another moſt manifeſtly. That is aparent, by diuers treatiſes written of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies. This is prooued by the differences of <hi>Thomiſtes</hi> and <hi>Scotiſtes,</hi> and of all Schoolemen one from an other. Neither doe they differ in ſmall matters, but in the higheſt pointes of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as namely <hi>whether the holy Ghoſt proceede more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally from the Father,</hi> then the Son, about the <hi>diuine notions,</hi> about the atributes of God, about <hi>Meritum Congrui,</hi> about the cauſe of predeſtination, about the thing deſigned by the word <hi>hoc</hi> in theſe wordes, <hi>hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> about the conception of the bleſſed Virgin, and all matters of diuinitie: as the treatiſes of Schoolemen doe plainely ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alſo doth in moſte controuerſies no leſſe earneſtly diſpute againſt his owne conſortes, then againſt vs. Neither is it materiall that all of them profeſſe themſelues willing to abide the Popes determination. For vntill he determine ſomewhat, their contentions are endleſſe. And albeit they then ceaſe to contend, yet their differences in opinions appeare neuertheleſſe.</p>

               <p>The ſeauenth chapter of his ſecond Booke, diſcou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And are bound by their Doctrine to follow him, although he leade them with him to the pit of hell. The Monkes alſo and Fryars, follow the heades and rules of their ſeueral ſectes, without looking whither they leade them.</p>
               <p>The eight marke of an Heretike ſaith he, <hi>is to be condemned by the church,</hi> or elſe as he ſaith afterward, <hi>by generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</hi> which doth no leſſe touch his holy Father, then the reſt. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the forme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Nicene <hi>councel. c. 4,</hi>
                  </hi> He giueth libertie to Abbots to conſecrate Biſhops, and contrarie to the <hi>5.</hi> Cannon ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth thoſe, that are excommunicated by other Biſhops Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>6.</hi> Canon hee inuadeth the dioceſes of other Patriarkes contrarye to another order hee ſeparateth Prieſtes from their wiues. With <hi>Eutyches</hi> condemned in the councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> hee beleeueth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a bodie, neither ſolide nor palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor like to ours. For ſuch is that body which he ſuppoſeth to be in the Sacrament. Likewiſe all the old Hereſies, which hee holdeth, are condemned by the whole Church. Laſtly all true Chriſtians, doe inwardly abhorre Popiſh impieties, idolatries, and Hereſies.</p>
               <p>Finally the Papiſts generally in the Chapt. <hi>ad abolendam. de haeret.</hi> condemne them for Heretikes, that teach contrarie to the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Church, concerning the Sacraments. But this doth notoriouſlye touch themſelues. For where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mention onely baptiſme, and the Lordes ſupper, as ſeales of Gods grace, they increaſe the number of Sacraments, and make ſeauen Where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>take and eate,</hi> they ſay, <hi>offer, heaue, hang vp,</hi> and <hi>carry about.</hi> Where <hi>Chriſt</hi> ordeined, that all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating one kinde ſhould alſo receiue the other, they ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly depriue the people of the cuppe. Finallye they teach, that Chriſtians are iuſtified by confirmation and extreame vnction, and that all their Sacraments haue like effectes.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, hee hath marked his owne conſortes with the markes of Heretikes. But hee ſhall neuer bee able to faſten his markes vppon vs. In the beginning of his ſecond Booke, hee tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177778:34"/> after his declamatorie manner of the diuels diſguiſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <hi>in the habit of a young gallant</hi> (like percaſe to the young Iebuſites and Maſſe-prieſtes, that going about to ſeduce ſimple ſoules attire themſelues like gallants) <hi>or of a Fryar.</hi> Hee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo his diſciples, <hi>that he is diſcryed eyther by his ſtaring eyes, or ſtinking ſauor, or horned head, or forked feete, or baſe voice.</hi> But firſt we would gladly knowe of him, why the deuill ſhould rather ſpeake in a baſe, then in a meane voice, and next how hee commeth ſo well acquainted with him, that hee knoweth his whole deſcription from his hornes to his clouen feete. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how it hapned that ſpeaking of the Deuill in the firſt part of the period, he forgot himſelfe in the ſecond, &amp; ſpeaketh of ſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Deuill, and of an Hereticke? what? are Heretikes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by their ſtaring eyes, and forked feete, and ſuch like partes? he telleth vs alſo of the pecking of Birdes, and the counterfeting of alchymiſtes, grauers and Heretickes, putting grauers of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous images nere to Heretikes, as they doe well deſerue. But what is that to vs? if heretikes be ſuch, as counterfet religion, and yet are gone out of the Church, then concerneth it vs nothing. For with our mouth we profeſſe, and with our hart we beleeue all the Chriſtian and Apoſtolike faith, and diſſent not from the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like church in any one article of faith profeſſed publikelye for a thouſand yeares after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nay wee doe onely relinquiſh the Papiſts, as Chriſtians in old time left the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and as ſome now leaue the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> wherein they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his truth. Either then muſt this <hi>K.</hi> ſhew, that as former heretikes haue done, we broach ſome doctrine contrarye to the ancient faith, or elſe hee talketh idelye of going out of the Church. Maiſter <hi>Luther</hi> he left the Papiſts hauing once folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their opinions, but not in any point of faith, but rather where they taught contrary to the faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly neuer ſhall he prooue, either that the profeſſors of our Religion are of a later ſtanding, then the moderne Papiſtes, or that our religion embraceth nouelties. For <hi>Luther</hi> is not our founder, nor any of late time, but the Apoſtles of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> whoſe doctrine <hi>left in depoſte</hi> to the church we embrace, deteſting all prophane nouelties of Papiſtes. Neither doe we bring in any new faith, but reiect the popiſh later Hereſies, and corruptions, though to ſome they ſeeme olde. But ſaith <hi>Kelliſon, the faith
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:177778:35"/> hath neuer increaſed in ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but onely in explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as if their Doctrine of traditions, of Romiſh interpretations, of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin vulgar tranſlation, of the <hi>7.</hi> ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by orders and extreme vnction, of tranſubſtantiation, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> carnall eating &amp; cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ping w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the teeth of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> fleſh, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; blood in the Maſſe, vnder the accidentes of breade &amp; wine, for quicke and dead, and the Popes vniuerſall Monarchie were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no ſubſtance; or elſe, as if the ſubſtance of theſe Articles had beene euer beleeued in the Church. This he would inſinuate, but the noueltie of them is ſo apparent, that his conſorts are much puzled, when they come to ſearch them in auncient writers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we neither call our ſelues <hi>Lutherians, Caluiniſtes, Zuinglians,</hi> nor any ſuch particular names. Neither is it materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the Papiſtes doe call vs in ſcorne by theſe names. For who doth credite the malicious tearmes of enemies? nay in this point we are more cléere then the papiſtes, that call themſelues, ſome <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> ſome <hi>Dominicans,</hi> ſome by other names; which we doe not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly wee renounce all old Hereſies condemned by aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Councels, and pronounce <hi>Florinus,</hi> that held God to bee the author of ſinne, <hi>Anathema.</hi> The like we ſay of <hi>Eunomius, Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and their conſortes. Neither was <hi>Caluin</hi> of other opinion, but that his malicious enemies doe falſely impute vnto him, that he ſhould teach, <hi>that God is the author of ſinne.</hi> Wee doe not ſay with <hi>Iouinian,</hi> that all ſins are equall, nor denie to the bodies of Chriſtians decent buriall. Nor did <hi>Hierome</hi> writing againſt <hi>Vigilantius</hi> allowe prayers to Saints departed, or the merits of Monkery, or teach as the Papiſtes doe, of vigils or lightes ſet vp in churches at noone time. But ſuppoſe he ſhold holde opinions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the truth; yet are not his wordes a rule of Hereſie. The ſecond ſynod at <hi>Nice</hi> allowed a certaine reuerence doone to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but nothing ſo much as the Papiſtes now giue to them. But whatſoeuer that ſynode decreed in that point, the ſame was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued in a ſynod at <hi>Frank-ford,</hi> and neuer generallye receiued eyther in the Eaſt or Weſt Churches. <hi>Aerius</hi> was reputed an Hereticke for <hi>Arianiſme,</hi> and not for finding fault with ſuperſtitious oblations for the dead. Whatſoeuer his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was it toucheth vs nothing, that doe allow the orders of the Church eſtabliſhed among vs. Finally we anathematize the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177778:35"/> of the <hi>Simonians Menandrians,</hi> and others (whome he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly ſurmiſeth to haue bene condemned for denying the real preſence) of the <hi>Meſſalians</hi> and <hi>Caians,</hi> (whome he imagineth to haue beene accounted Heretikes for denying the ſacramentes to conteine grace, as the Papiſtes hold it) of the <hi>Nouatians,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed repentance to publike ſinners, of the <hi>Gnoſtikes, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> and <hi>Encratites</hi> (whome hee ignorantlye ſurmiſeth to haue beene condemned for denying marryage to bee a Sacrament) of <hi>Heluidius, Rhetorius</hi> and all other auncient condemned Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. If then this Hereticke will obiect Hereſies to vs, hee muſt both ſet downe the wordes of the Hereſie condemned by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, and prooue, that wee holde ſuch an Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, wee want no proofe of our Religion, which may be drawne from true ſucceſſion. For we do not only communicate in matters of faith with the Apoſtles, but alſo with the auncient Biſhops of <hi>Hieruſalem, Antioche, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for a thouſand yeares. Wee ſucceede alſo to the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> before Biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> in al things, which they taught well, and according to the Catholike fayth. But could we ſhew no line of ſucceſſion; yet if we agree in doctrine with the Apoſtles and firſt Biſhops of the Chriſtian Church, it is ſufficient. <hi>Ad hanc formam prouocabuntur ab illis eccleſiis</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian <hi>de praeſcript. aduerſ. haeret. quae licet nullum ex apoſtolis, vel apoſtolicis authorem ſuum proferant, vt multo poſteriores, quae deni<expan>

                  </hi> He telleth vs playnly, <hi>that they are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike Churches</hi> that teach <hi>the ſame Doctrine, albeit they were not founded by the Apoſtles or Apoſtolike men,</hi> nor had any ſucceſſion of Biſhops. Likewiſe hee ſheweth, that <hi>they are the Apoſtles heires, that hold that fayth, which is conteined in their Teſtament.</hi> Seeing then we do only publiſh Apoſtolicall Doctrine, and purge away Popiſh errors; our Churches are moſt truly Apoſtolicall. But ſayth <hi>K. <hi>pag.</hi> 196. This is to make bare Scripture judge of our Doctrine,</hi> and as much, as if we ſhould ſay, <hi>that the Church of God fayled,</hi> and <hi>that the Synagogue of the Diuell poſſeſſed the world many yeares.</hi> Hee telleth alſo <hi>how <hi>Luther</hi> in his preface before the diſputation of <hi>Lipſia,</hi> van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had firſt publiſhed Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>firſt</hi> this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abuſe of Heretikes, to call Scriptures <hi>bare.

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:177778:36"/> do clearely diſperſe this cloud of ſlaunder. But his fooliſh attempt may giue cauſe to vs, to touch both him and his conſortes, for their manifold and blaſphemous impietyes. In the beginning of his third Booke he ſayth, <hi>that as the <hi>Stoickes</hi> commend <hi>Zeno,</hi> the <hi>Platonickes Plato,</hi> the <hi>Peripatetickes Ariſtotle,</hi> the <hi>Epicureans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picure,</hi> the <hi>Atheiſtes Diagoras,</hi>
                  </hi> ſo <hi>Chriſtians ſhould ſpeake hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of Chriſt.</hi> But if he had not beene of the ſect of <hi>Diagoras,</hi> and a prophane <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> he would haue bluſhed to haue compared <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Diagoras,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> two prophane and impious men; and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Atheiſtes,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> and prophane followers of Philoſophers. He would alſo haue forborne to haue concluded, that chriſtians are to honor <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Atheiſtes</hi> honor <hi>Diagoras.</hi> But to referre the examination of the impious Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this <hi>Atheiſt</hi> and his conſorts to his proper place, what hath he to obiect againſt vs and our Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> perſon, or nature?</p>
               <p>Firſt he telleth vs, how <hi>Michael Seruetus</hi> was a brother of our Religion, <hi>and denyed that God the Sonne was true God, or coaequall to his Father.</hi> But whatſoeuer his blaſphemyes were, he learned them among the <hi>Papiſtes,</hi> where he was brought vp, and not among vs, where he was puniſhed for his blaſphemyes. Secondly he ſeemeth to be rather a brother of the <hi>Papiſtes,</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whome hee learned his impieties, and with whome hee defended the adoration of Angels, then of kinred to vs. <hi>Thirdly</hi> this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Surueyor attributeth the hereſie of the <hi>Arians</hi> vnto <hi>Serue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> where he did wholy deny the <hi>Trinity,</hi> calling all that beleeue the holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> atheiſtes; as may appeare in the proceedings againſt him.</p>
               <p>Next he ſaith, <hi>that Luther in his book againſt Latomus affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that he could not abide this word, homoouſion.</hi> A matter moſt falſe and ſlaunderous. His words are <hi>conditional. Quod ſi odit anima mea vocem homoouſion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>et nolim ea vti, non ero haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, quis enim me coget vti, modo rem tenea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quae in concilio per ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turas definita eſt?</hi> ſo it appeareth hee held the thing, and that not wordes, but matters, in his conceite, made Heretickes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee telleth, <hi>how Luther in <hi>commentar. in C.</hi> 1. <hi>Geneſ.</hi> called the Sonne of God, the inſtrument of God, by which hee created the world.</hi> But like an honeſt Surueyor, hee confeſſeth <hi>that he hath not ſeene thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries.</hi> and perhaps he wold
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177778:36"/> not ſee them. For if he had, he might haue ſeene himſelfe conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be a lying companion. Now he ſheweth himſelfe onely to be a light fellow, that beleeueth fables vppon heare ſay. In his comentaries vpon that booke now no ſuch matter is to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> he chargeth <hi>Luther</hi> with leauing out theſe words in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Litany <hi>ſancta trinitas, vnus deus, miſerere nobis:</hi> &amp; the word <hi>deus</hi> out of this ſentence, <hi>deus fortis,</hi> and out of the firſt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the fift Chapter, this ſentence, <hi>there are three which giue witneſſe in heauen, the father, the word, &amp; the holy Ghoſt, &amp; theſe three are one.</hi> But firſt the reaſon, why he left out the wordes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Litany was not for miſlik of the word <hi>Trinitie,</hi> but for that the dutch word <hi>dreifaltigheit</hi> did ſignifie rather triplicitie, then Trinitie. Secondlye it is not like, that <hi>Luther</hi> did omit ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word <hi>Deus,</hi> or the ſentence in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> epiſtle, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> becauſe we finde not that obiected vnto him by his moſte curious aduerſaries. But what if by negligence, or fault of the Coppie theſe wordes had beene omitted, what is that to vs, that doe not omitte them? hath the ſurueyor forgot, that hee promiſeth a ſuruey of our Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> he chargeth <hi>Luther</hi> with ſaying, <hi>that as <hi>Eutyches</hi> ſaid, ſo it may well be ſaid, that the diuinitie of Chriſt ſuffred.</hi> But this ſlaunder is refuted not onely by <hi>Luthers</hi> booke <hi>de concilijs,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> preface in his diſpute <hi>de Chriſto.</hi> He one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, <hi>that he diſputed with <hi>Neſtorians</hi> which contended that the diuinitie of Chriſt could not ſuffer.</hi> But hee doth not ſay that Chriſtes diuine nature could ſuffer, as <hi>Eutyches</hi> did, and as this <hi>K.</hi> would haue vs to ſurmiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page <hi>247.</hi>
                  </hi> He imputeth vnto <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that hee ſhould ſay both in hs booke of common places, and in his book againſt <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>karus, <hi>that the Sonne of God according to his diuinitie pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Father for his kingdome, glory, and inheritance, and that the diuine nature of the Sonne was obedient to his Father in his paſſion.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>the like ſaying</hi> ſaith <hi>K. hath <hi>Beza,</hi> yea, and <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo.</hi> But if eyther of them had ſaid any thing, wherupon this accuſer might ground his ſlaunder; he would not haue ſpared to haue ſet downe their words at full. <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath not theſe words <hi>according to his diuinitie.</hi> But what if he ſhould ſpeake improperly, ſhold he not haue leaue to interpret himſelfe? Againe ſuppoſe there were an error in his words, muſt we ſatiſfie for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177778:37"/> his fault? Laſtly who knoweth not, that the Fathers ſometime by the diuinitie and humanitie of Chriſt ſinglye vnderſtand his perſon?</p>
               <p>Afterward <hi>Page. <hi>248.</hi>
                  </hi> he inueigheth againſt the <hi>Vbiquetaries who affirme</hi> as hee ſaith, <hi>that the diuine attributes are reallye communicated vnto Chriſtes humane nature.</hi> But heerein hee ſheweth great ſimplicitie. For this toucheth the Papiſts that wil haue <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body to bee both in heauen and earth, and vppon euerie alter at one time: which being graunted the <hi>Vbiquetaries omnipreſence</hi> doth followe neceſſarily, ſeeing a body cannot bee in two remote places, but it muſt be in the midſt. Secondly, they wil haue this communication to be <hi>per communicationem idioma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> ſo that it appeareth, their meaning is, that <hi>after a manner of ſpeech</hi> theſe diuine attributes are communicated to <hi>Chriſtes</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Finallye of the opinion of the reall preſence of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> bodye in the Sacrament taught by Papiſts, this error of the <hi>Vbiquetaries,</hi> whether in ſpeech or Doctrine proceeded: and therefore it toucheth our aduerſaries verie neere, and vs nothing at all.</p>
               <p>In the ſame place hee chargeth <hi>Caluin</hi> for teaching, <hi>that the name of God is attributed to the Father</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and that hee denyeth Chriſt to be God of God.</hi> Hee ſaith alſo <hi>that <hi>Whitaker</hi> heerein ſubſcribeth vnto him,</hi> and laſtlye <hi>that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi> and <hi>Iewell</hi> and diuers other affirme, that Chriſt according to his Diuinitie was Preeſt and mediator.</hi> But firſt both <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and this brabler doth calumniouſlye reporte <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes. For writing againſt <hi>Valentinus Gentilis</hi> hee ſaith not, that the father as God hath any preheminence, but as hee is the firſt perſon in the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and as the Sonne is begotten of the Father. Secondly hee denyeth not, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is God of God, but onely ſaith, that the phraſe is hard, and meaneth, that wee are to vnderſtand the wordes perſonally thus, Chriſt which is God is of the Father, which is God, &amp; not as if there were two Gods the one proceeding from the other. <hi>Thirdly</hi> Maiſter <hi>Whitakers</hi> wordes being ſet downe would cleare him. For his meaning is, that the diuine eſſence doth neither engender, nor is ingendered, thoſe being properties of the perſons. Finally both Maiſter <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin,</hi> and the reuerend Father Biſhop <hi>Iewell,</hi> and other our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines doe teach aright, that the office of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> mediation and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177778:37"/> Préeſt-hood belongeth not to eyther nature, ſingly conſidered in it ſelfe, but to the perſon, that is God and man. But the aduerſaries that wil haue <hi>Chriſt</hi> as God to act nothing, but aſcribe the whole office of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Preeſt-hood to the humane nature, doe deuide the perſon, and not onelye the two natures, approching neerer to <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> then our teachers to error.</p>
               <p>Finally hee alleadgeth the teſtimony of <hi>Egidius Hunnius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caluin, as if in expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſcriptures he did Iudaizare, or fauour the Iewes.</hi> But neither is the teſtimony of a ſworne enemie to be much regarded, nor hath any man that felicitie in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scriptures, that he fayleth in nothing.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond chap. he chargeth vs, <hi>that we make Chriſt an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd redeemer,</hi> theſe are the words of this abſurd ſurueyor. And why ſo, I pray you? forſooth becauſe we hope onelye to be iuſtified by <hi>Chriſtes</hi> iuſtice. But this doth not touch vs onely, but the holy prophets, &amp; apoſtles alſo. God by his prpophet <hi>Iſay. c. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>his iuſt ſeruant ſhall iuſtifie many by his knowledge, &amp; ſhal beare their ſins.</hi> The Apoſtle. <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</hi> teacheth vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is made vnto vs <hi>wiſdome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification &amp; rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption.</hi> To make his matter good <hi>page. <hi>257.</hi>
                  </hi> hee maketh vs to ſay, <hi>that there is no juſtice but Chriſtes juſtice, nor good workes but Chriſtes workes, nor merit but his merit, nor ſatisfaction but his ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</hi> But theſe are his owne ſottiſh ideotiſmes, and not our wordes. For wee doe not denye that there is a certaine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect iuſtice in man ſanctified by Gods holy ſpirit, and that ſuch doe good workes pleaſing vnto God. We confeſſe alſo, that man by ſinne doth merit death, albeit his workes be not ſo perfect, that they can deſerue eternall life. Finally we know, that the Fathers ſometime accompt the obedience of the law to bee a ſatiſfaction, and ſo cal the performance of penalties enioyned by the Church. But did we attribute all the honor of our iuſtification and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Sauiour; yet this is neither abſurditie, nor diſhonour to him. But this abſurd and kettle Diuine dooth diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and blaſpheme <hi>Chriſt</hi> ioyning the wordes, <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> together. He doth alſo contradict the Scriptures, where hee ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt with one word, or teare, or drop of blood might haue redeemed vs.</hi> And therein he paſſeth the impudency of his holy Father <hi>Clement <hi>the ſixt in the chap.</hi> vnigenit. extr. de poenit. &amp; remiſſ.</hi> for he ſaith, <hi>one drop of blood would haue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:177778:38"/> But this dropping &amp; dreary dunſe <hi>addeth a teare or a word.</hi> How co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie they are to ſcriptures, theſe teſtimonies declare <hi>Iſay. <hi>53. therfore ſhal he deuide the ſpoiles of the ſtrong, becauſe he hath giuen his ſoule to death.</hi> Mat. <hi>20.</hi>
                  </hi> We reade, that <hi>he came to giue his life a ranſome for many,</hi> and <hi>Luc. <hi>24. that ſo Chriſt muſt ſuffer.</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>1. <hi>cor.</hi> 15. that Chriſt dyed for vs according to the Scriptures. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3,</hi> We learne, <hi>that to deliuer vs from the curſe of the law he was made accurſed,</hi> and <hi>Hebr. <hi>2. that it was fitting, that the author of our ſaluation ſhould by ſuffering be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummated.</hi>
                  </hi> &amp; <hi>Heb. <hi>9. that his teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t could not bee fulfilled without the death of the teſtator.</hi>
                  </hi> Abſurdly alſo he talketh of a ſtorme rayſed in heauen for the Sonne of God, when <hi>Lucifer</hi> wold be like the higheſt. For it is ridiculous to thinke of any ſtirre or ſtorme rayſed in Heauen, where there is, and alwaies was ſuch quiet and content; or to ſuppoſe that <hi>Lucifer</hi> contended with the Sonne of God. Hee might doe well to tell vs what Deuill tolde him this. For in holy Scriptures no ſuch thing is found. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deſcribing the bleſſed ſtate of man in Paradice, and of his miſerie being throwne out of Paradice, vnawares he ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with his boyſterous eloquence two bulwarks of Popery, to wit <hi>Freewill</hi> and <hi>Purgatory.</hi> For <hi>if euery ſinner bee a ſlaue to his fleſh,</hi> and <hi>a captiue to the Diuell,</hi> and <hi>a ſlaue to ſinne, and the Diuell,</hi> as hee ſaith; then hath hee not freewill. For to bee free, and bound at one time implyeth contradiction. Againe, <hi>if the deuill hold ſinners in hell perpetuallye,</hi> as <hi>page. <hi>254.</hi>
                  </hi> hee confeſſeth, then there is no redemption out of Purgatory, which as Papiſts teach, is in hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag. <hi>258.</hi>
                  </hi> he chargeth vs farther, that we teach, <hi>that good workes are not neceſſary,</hi> and thence inferre, <hi>that no Lawes ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane or diuine can bind vs in conſcience.</hi> And laſtly he ſayth that we hold <hi>that no ſinnes, nor euill workes can hurt vs, becauſe Chriſtes juſtice being ours, no ſinne can make vs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> And ſo he runneth on in a courſe of wild eloquence, like a Colte that hath broken his halter. But as <hi>Hierome ſayth</hi> in his Booke againſt <hi>Vigila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius, <hi>ſtultum eſt fingere materiam, cui rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica declamatione reſpondeatur.</hi> It is a fooliſh and dizardly thing, to feine</hi> matters, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a rhetorical ſurueying declamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. In his fictions certes this man ſeemeth neither to haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor conſcience. For firſt albeit we ſay, that we are not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177778:38"/> by workes; yet we teach, that as many as are iuſtified by faith in Chriſt, are alſo ſanctified by his grace, and that workes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effects of our iuſtification. <hi>Secondly</hi> we directly affirme, that Gods Lawes doe bind in conſcience, and mans Lawes as farre as they commaund for Gods Lawe, albeit through <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> we are deliuered from the curſe of the law, being iuſtified by fayth, and <hi>walking no more after the fleſh, but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Thirdly</hi> we beleeue, that all ſinnes and euill workes do hurt thoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doe them. Although we alſo beleeue, that he who is borne of God, and iuſtified by fayth, ſinneth not vnto death. Finally moſt falſely he maketh vs to teach firſt, <hi>that Chriſt hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs, becauſe no ſinne can hurt vs;</hi> and next, <hi>that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the Law, becauſe no Law can binde vs;</hi> and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are deliuered from the Diuel and Hel, becauſe howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we liue, they cannot hurt vs.</hi> Nay we pronounce him <hi>ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,</hi> that ſhall hold, that eyther ſinne cannot hurt, or that the Law bindeth not, or that howſoeuer Chriſtians liue, they cannot be damned to Hell. And thus much may ſerue to cleare vs from this barking curres ſlaunders.</p>
               <p>But Popiſh Doctrine concerning our redemption is not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily defended. For Papiſtes beleeue, that the Pope by his indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences can redeeme ſoules from Hell. They teach alſo, that euery man is to ſatiſfie for his ſinnes committed after Baptiſme. But then <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but halfe a redeemer. Neither do they ſticke to ſay, that the ſonne of God aſſuming the nature of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> or ſome other might haue redeemed the world: which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the promiſes made to the Fathers concerning the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> to come of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham. Kelliſon <hi>pag.</hi> 261.</hi> ſayth, <hi>that Chriſtes Paſſion was not our formall juſtification, nor ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction</hi> (he ſhould haue ſaid <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Paſſion, obedience, and iuſtice, if he would formally haue croſſed our Doctrine) <hi>but only the meritorious cauſe, of our redemption and ſaluation, which deſerueth for vs at Gods hands grace, by which together with our cooperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may be ſaued &amp; redeemed.</hi> But if <hi>Chriſt be not our formal juſtice,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iuſtice was not made our iuſtice: which contradicteth the Apoſtle <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</hi> If <hi>he did not form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſatiſfie for vs,</hi> then he dyed almoſt in vaine, and we are to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie for our ſelues. If <hi>he be only the meritorious cauſe of our redemption and ſaluation,</hi> then hath not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaued or redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177778:39"/> vs, but we are to ſaue and redeeme our ſelues, as well as we can. If <hi>by grace together with our cooperation we are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and redeemed,</hi> as this <hi>K.</hi> ſaith; then we are formally ſaued and redeemed without <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which only commeth in as a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe. Beſide that, if <hi>grace</hi> here <hi>be nothing but charity,</hi> or a habit not diſtinct from Charity, as Schoole-men teach; then our owne workes properly ſaue vs, and not <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Paſſion. Finally <hi>if Chriſtes redemption of vs from ſinne, be nothing elſe, but a deſeruing of grace, by which we diſpoſe our ſelues to juſtification,</hi> &amp; <hi>if he hath freed vs from the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and captiuity of Hell, becauſe he hath procured vs grace, by which we may reſiſt maugre all the force of Hell,</hi> and <hi>hath ſatiſfied for our ſinnes, to obtaine vs grace, that we may ſatiſfie for all our ſinnes,</hi> as this wicked blaſphemer teacheth <hi>pag. <hi>262.</hi>
                  </hi> Then is man the principall cauſe of his owne iuſtification, and good workes ſhould goe before iuſtification, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould not deſerue to be called our redeemer, or ſauiour, but a grace giuer, that men might free and redeeme them ſelues. And laſtly not <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſatiſfie for vs, but wee ſhould ſatiſfie for our ſelues: All which poyntes are not only contrarie to Scriptures and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, but vtterly ouerthrow the worke of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> ſatiſfaction and ranſome payd for vs.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter of his third Booke hee goeth on rayling againſt vs, &amp; cryeth out with open mouth, <hi>that we make Chriſt no redeemer at all,</hi> and his reaſon is, <hi>for that we teach, that euen righteous men are ſinners,</hi> and <hi>that our ſinnes are couered by the imputation of Chriſt his ſatiſfaction and righteouſneſſe.</hi> But his Collection is ſo fooliſh, that if there were a whole couent of Fooles in place, he might well prooue Abbot. For <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> ſayth, that <hi>if we ſay we haue no ſinne, we deceiue our ſelues, and the truth is not in vs.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth, <hi>bleſſed are they, whoſe iniquities are forgiuen, and whoſe ſinnes are couered.</hi> And yet <hi>Kelliſon</hi> will not ſay, but that theſe holy Apoſtles acknowledged <hi>Chriſt</hi> to bee their redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Our Sauiour alſo taught the Apoſtles to pray for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of their treſpaſſes. Finally to ſay, that a Chriſtian can liue without ſin, is playne Pelagianiſme. <hi>Hierome <hi>dialog.</hi> 1. <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. Pelagianos</hi>
                  </hi> ſetteth downe theſe two propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground of Pelagianiſme, <hi>that a man may be without ſinne, if he will,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:177778:39"/> and <hi>that Gods commaundements are eaſie. Saint Auguſtine</hi> likewiſe <hi>Lib. de haereſ. c. <hi>88.</hi>
                  </hi> reckoneth this aſſertion among the heades of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his hereſie, <hi>that the life of juſt-men in this world hath no ſinne at all.</hi> Neither is <hi>Kelliſons</hi> exception of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moment For it followeth not, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> make not men cleare without ſinne, that <hi>Adam</hi> is more potent then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe all his poſteritie were made ſinners. For by the ſame reaſon it may be ſayd, that as all men were made ſinners by <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo all ſhould be made righteous by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Furthermore the power of <hi>Chriſts</hi> grace exceedeth <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion in this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red man of his meere grace. But <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie by his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion incurred the penalty therof deſeruedly. The Apoſtle ſheweth, that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> grace exceeded <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion. For <hi>Chriſt</hi> pardoned many offences, but death came by one mans offence.</p>
               <p>He doth alſo charge vs, <hi>that we affirme, that notwith-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtes grace, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſiſt any temptation of the fleſh, or the Deuill, that we cannot fulfill the Law</hi> (in any ſort) <hi>that we cannot doe any good worke, but muſt needs ſinne in all our actions.</hi> But if hee cannot prooue, that we doe ſo teach; then I thinke he cannot deny, but that he hath ſinned in this action. Let him therfore name them, that ſo teach, and prooue it out of their wordes if he canne. Or elſe it will appeare, that we teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which ſtandeth with truth, and with the honor of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in atcheuing our redemption.</p>
               <p>But our aduerſaries will not ſo eaſily acquit themſelues of teaching lewdly, concerning the article of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through <hi>Chriſt.</hi> For firſt <hi>Kelliſon</hi> teacheth, <hi>pag. <hi>261.</hi>
                  </hi> as before is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>that Chriſt is only the meritorious cauſe of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> which is as much as if hee ſhould aſcribe the principall and formall cauſe to our ſelues. Secondly he ſayth, <hi>that Chriſt gaue vs grace, by which together with our cooperation we may bee ſaued and redeemed.</hi> Which being graunted, it followeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> redeemed vs not, but only procured vs grace, wherby wee might redeeme our ſelues. Thirdly both hee and his conſortes teach, that euerye man ought to ſatiſfye for his ſinnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſme. But if a man do ſatiſfye for his ſinnes, then is hee his owne redeemer. <hi>Fourthly</hi> the Papiſtes hope by the merits of Saintes, to be ſaued and redeemed. But as he, that ſerueth many
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177778:40"/> Gods, ſerueth no God truelye; ſo hee that hath many redeemers hath no true redeemer. <hi>Fiftlye</hi> they beleeue, that the Pope by his indulgences can redeeme ſoules out of purgatorie. Which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> redemption is vnſufficient. Finallye in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Maſſe they profeſſe, that they offer <hi>pro redemptione ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum ſuarum:</hi> as if the Prieſt with the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, could redeeme ſoules.</p>
               <p>By the verie ſame argument alſo, <hi>Lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </hi> he endeuoureth to prooue, <hi>that wee make Chriſt no ſpirituall Phiſition.</hi> As if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not cure our diſeaſes, when he couereth them, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth his iuſtice vnto vs, and ſanctifieth vs by the holy Ghoſt. But if his argument were concludent, then muſt hee himſelfe alſo affirme, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is no ſpirituall Phiſition. For he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, I trow, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dooth couer our ſinnes, and that no man in this life is ſo perfectly cured, but that hee committeth diuers ſinnes. To ſay otherwiſe is flat pelagianiſme. Furthermore he is a good Phiſition that taketh away the paine of the diſeaſe, albeit hée cannot for the weakeneſſe of the patient cure the reliques thereof altogether. And <hi>Iſay, c. <hi>53.</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith <hi>we are healed by the woundes of Chriſt.</hi> Yet no man will ſay, that in this frailty wee are ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that we ſinne not. Finally, there is a great diſproportion and diſſimilitude betwixt the diſeaſes of the bodye and the ſoule. The paines of the ſoule diſeaſes follow after this life, the paines of bodilye ſickneſſes come together with the diſeaſe. For the ſoule diſeaſes God puniſheth; for bodilye diſeaſes the Phiſition pitieth the patient. The ſoule diſeaſes conſiſt in diſobedience, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which being once done, cannot bée vndoone. But diſeaſes of the bodie conſiſt in diſtemper, or other euill qualitie, which may be remooued. Although then the diſeaſes of the body may be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; yet the diſeaſes of the ſoule cannot bee perfectly cured, ſo long as we liue in this world. Nay albeit this <hi>K.</hi> take <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his Phiſition; yet he will not ſay, that hee is cured of all ignorance, malice, defectes and infirmities. Moſt ridiculous therefore is his diſcourſe of the diſeaſes of the ſoule, and of <hi>his reſine and empla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of 7. Sacraments,</hi> and of <hi>his burning in purgatorye,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Schoole-trickes and foolerye, and more like to make his reader ſicke with the ſurfet of his ſuruey, then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>The fift Chapter of his third Booke, containeth a fragment of ſome Schoole-lecture concerning the honor due to Law-giuers.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177778:40"/> But while he would ſeeme to honour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with the title of a Lawgiuer, he doth much diſhonour him comparing him to <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> nay, to <hi>Lycurgus, Solon, Romulus, Plato, Triſmegiſtus,</hi> and I know not who. Againſt vs all his bablement maketh nothing. For albeit we doe not confound the law, and the goſpell, nor make <hi>Chriſt</hi> a lawgiuer like to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> or an exactor of the penalties of lawes, as doe the Papiſts; yet we doe not denye, that hee may be tearmed, and is after a ſort a Lawgiuer. Neither doth eyther <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Caluin,</hi> deny this abſolutelye, as this <hi>K.</hi> affirmeth. Hardly therefore will hee bee able to charge vs with any fault in this behalfe, vnleſſe he will falſifye our wordes, as hee doth <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uins. lib. 3. <hi>Inſtit. c.</hi> 19. 10.</hi> making him to conclude, <hi>that Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians are exempted from all lawes:</hi> where he hath no ſuch words and onely ſpeaketh of ceremonies, that may bee obſerued and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But the Papiſts, albeit they make <hi>Chriſt</hi> a Law-giuer, and make that a part of his honour; yet they giue the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Pope, <hi>c. tranſlato. de conſtitutionibus:</hi> ſhewing themſelues to be ſubiects of an other Kingdome, then that of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſixt Chapter he rayleth not onely at man, but at God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him abſolutely <hi>an angry God,</hi> and ſuppoſing, that his wrath is no way to be appeaſed, but by the maſſe-prieſts ſacrifices. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered two ſacrifices, the one at his laſt ſupper, the other vpon the Croſſe, and <hi>that he hath many vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</hi> But that is contrary to the wordes of the Apoſtle. <hi>Heb. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </hi> who ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt was once offered to take away the ſinnes of many.</hi> This is derogatorie to the honor of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is a Prieſt for euer after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and cannot well ſtand with the Popes generall vicarſhip, or the office of Maſſe-prieſtes his ſuppoſed vicegerents. Againſt vs his vaine brable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes effecte nothing, ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Prieſt according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> in regard, that he ſucceedeth none, nor hath any ſucceſſors or vicegerents in this ſacrifice, that he offered once vpon the Croſſe. Furthermore this preeſthood of Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> we maintaine, the Papiſtes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, as at full I haue declared in my third booke <hi>de miſſa</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> where alſo the abſurdities and contradictions of the Maſſe-prieſtes are particularly diſciphred.</p>
               <p>In the ſeauenth Chapter of his third booke moſte wickedly hée would make the world beleeue, <hi>that we deny Chriſt to be iudge
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177778:41"/> of quicke and dead.</hi> And his reaſon is, for that <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt ſhall not condemne a faithfull man.</hi> As if it were not the part of a iudge, as wel to acquite, as to condemne. Further if this argument were concludent; then ſhould <hi>Kelliſon</hi> denye <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be iudge of quicke and dead. For I hope he will not ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will at the laſt day <hi>condemne faithfull men.</hi> He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alſo, <hi>that we deny to Chriſt, two offices of a judge,</hi> to wit, <hi>remuneration, and diſcuſſion,</hi> becauſe we teach, that man in this corruption of his nature cannot merit heauen by his workes, and that no ſinne is in his owne proper nature veniall. But neither is this argument better then the former. For although mens works deſerue not the fauour and reward, that ſhall be ſhewed them; yet no man will deny, that God almightie that iudgeth of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may reward them. And albeit no ſinne is veniall in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, if wee reſpect the rigour of the lawe; yet there is great difference betwixt ſinne and ſinne, and the iudge is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to iudge of the qualitie of ſinnes, but alſo to examine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe, whether the partie haue ſinned or not. Much idle talke alſo dooth hee ſpend about <hi>Chriſtes two aduents,</hi> as hee calleth them, and about <hi>Iewiſh</hi> fancies concerning the Sonne of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that, as they dreamed, <hi>was to be ſlaine in the battell of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi>
                  </hi> and of the diſpatch of the iudgement <hi>in a triſe,</hi> and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the ſentence <hi>in an audible voice.</hi> But becauſe theſe Schoole-boyes fancies belong not to this argument, I wil referre them to bee cenſured by his owne fantaſticall diſciples. In the meane while I would pray this ſurueyor either to prooue them more demonſtratiuely, or to affirme them more modeſtly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>8.</hi> chapter containeth a packe of calumniations againſt vs for teaching, that Chriſtians are iuſtified by faith apprehending <hi>Chriſtes</hi> iuſtice, that is imputed vnto vs. And heereof hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that all men are not onely equally iuſt, and perfect, as the <hi>Beguardes</hi> ſaid, but alſo as iuſt as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe. But his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is fooliſh &amp; abſurde. For although by Chriſtes ſatiſfaction and merits wee are all iuſtifyed, and acquited; yet there is an imperfect iuſtice in all the faithful, in ſome more, in ſome leſſe, and no way comparable to <hi>Chriſtes</hi> iuſtice. As for the perfection of <hi>Beguardes</hi> and <hi>Beguines,</hi> it proceeded from the opinion of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh perfection, and therefore much rather deſerueth to bee impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Papiſts, then to vs. Papiſts alſo ſay, that a man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:177778:41"/> the law perfectly, and that no man is ſaued, but hee that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth the law. But of the firſt we may conclude, that their iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice is equall to the iuſtice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who performed the lawe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlye, and that all they, that are ſaued by the lawe are equall in iuſtice: matters ſomewhat ſtrange and abſurd, yet following ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily of our aduerſaries Doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the ninth chapter hee goeth about to prooue, <hi>that we bring the new Teſtament, and Chriſtian religion into queſtion.</hi> But of all this greate ſlaunder, hee hath no other ground, then this ſmall and ſimple collection, that therefore we doe ſo, becauſe wee teach, <hi>that Chriſt as man, knew not the day of judgement,</hi> and <hi>that hee increaſed in wiſdome.</hi> But therein wee teach nothing but that which both the Scriptures affirme, and ancient Fathers beleeued. Chriſt ſpeaking of the laſt day <hi>Marc. <hi>13. no man knoweth</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith he, <hi>no not the Sonne, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> alſo <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de filio: nouit vt deus</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith he, <hi>vt homo ſe dicit ignorare.</hi> The ſame is prooued by the teſtimonie of <hi>Cyril. Luke.</hi> chap. <hi>2.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Ieſus increaſed in wiſdome, &amp; ſtature, &amp; in fauour with God &amp; men.</hi> And heereupon <hi>Ambroſe</hi> writeth, <hi>that Chriſt according to the fleſh was filled with wiſdome and grace. Maxentius</hi> alſo in <hi>profeſſ. fid. cath.</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that Chriſt according to his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did grow and profit in age and wiſedome. <hi>Quamobrem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendum eſt</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith he, <hi>deum natum ex foemina non ſecundum diuinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſed ſecundum humanitatem, deum in cunis iacentem, pannoſum, ſordibus inuolutum creuiſſe et profeciſſe, aetate, et ſapientia ſecundum humanitatem, non ſecundum diuinitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man by the Vnion be <hi>omniſcient,</hi> why is he not <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and <hi>praeſent in all places?</hi> and why ſhould not al the reſt of the diuine attributes be really tranſfuſed into his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, as well as this one?</p>
               <p>In the the tenth Chapter he ſaith, <hi>we make Chriſt a deſperate man,</hi> and for proofe he alleadgeth certaine places, as taken out of <hi>Caluin.</hi> But what if <hi>Caluin</hi> haue not theſe wordes? doth not this <hi>K.</hi> deſperately abuſe his readers patience? I would alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that Maiſter <hi>Caluin</hi> is wronged, but that the enemies of truth take pleaſure in ſlaundring him. Whoſoeuer liſt to compare <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes with <hi>Kelliſons</hi> reporte, ſhall eaſilye perceiue the wrong offered him. For neither dooth hee ſay, <hi>that the horrible confuſion of damnation did fiercelye torment Chriſt with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177778:42"/> feare, nor that hee had to doe with the iudgement of God,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Kelliſon</hi> impute both vnto him Falſelye alſo hee tranſlateth <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes in <hi>Math. c. <hi>27.</hi> v. <hi>46.</hi>
                  </hi> turning <hi>reum, <hi>culpable,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>exitio deuotus, <hi>already condemned,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp; making him to affirme, that which hee obiecteth to himſelfe, and anſwereth. But ſuppoſe <hi>Caluin</hi> in tearmes had paſſed to farre; yet if this ſurueyor had doon his office, hee would not haue reported other mens wordes, for groundes of our religion.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth chapter conteineth nothing but an inuectiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caluin,</hi> who ſuppoſed, that the article of the creede concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Chriſtes</hi> diſcending into hell, ought to be expounded of his greeuous ſuffringes in his ſoule, which in bitterneſſe might be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangoned, as he thought, to helliſh paines. But all this concerneth vs and our religion nothing, which miſlike his particular opinion heerein. All this while therefore, that he bauled againſt Maiſter <hi>Caluin,</hi> the Surueyor ſeemeth to bée out of his way. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more moſte ſhamefully hee belyeth <hi>Caluin</hi> diuers waies. Firſt he ſaith, that <hi>Caluin acknowledged no locall hell.</hi> Secondly <hi>that hee affirmed, that theſe wordes, my God my God why haſt thou forſaken mee, were the wordes of a damned man.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>that Caluin at the houre of death diſpayred and called vpon the Deuill.</hi> The two firſt are confuted by his writings vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Creede, and the paſſion. The laſt by the teſtimonie of all that were preſent at his death Neither muſt <hi>Kelliſon</hi> thinke to eſcape hell for reporting theſe helliſh vntruthes deuiſed by <hi>Bolſec, Genebrard,</hi> and ſuch like hel-houndes, vnleſſe hee repent. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee ſaith firſt, that all helliſh paines are without end. Next hee counteth it ſtrange, that <hi>Caluin</hi> brought <hi>Chriſt</hi> into hell. And laſtly affirmeth, <hi>that Chriſtes blood was ſufficient to redeeme the Deuill, and the damned.</hi> But his followers teach firſt, that the paines of purgatorie are helliſh, and cauſed by the flames of hell. Next they ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>limbus patrum,</hi> whither <hi>Chriſt</hi> diſcended is in hell, and laſtly that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not to redeeme Deuils, nor tooke the nature of Deuils, but of men.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>12.</hi> Chapter he goeth about to traduce vs, as not louing Chriſt. And why? Forſooth becauſe ſayth hee, <hi>you loue not the Mother of Chriſt,</hi> nor <hi>the Saintes,</hi> nor <hi>the Croſſe,</hi> nor <hi>the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of Chriſt or the Saintes,</hi> nor <hi>his Nayles,</hi> and <hi>other things belonging to him.</hi> He might if it had pleaſed him, haue added
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:177778:42"/> alſo the <hi>Aſſe,</hi> wheron Chriſt rode to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and the Bones of the Paſchall Lambe, and the Baſkets wherin the Fragmentes were gathered, after hee had fed fiue thouſand with fiue Barly loues and two Fiſhes. But how prooueth hee, that we doe not loue the bleſſed Mother of God nor the Saintes? Forſooth becauſe we do not worſhip them, as the Papiſtes doe. But if this bee an argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of want of loue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither the Apoſtles, nor firſt Chrſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans loued <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his Saintes. He telleth alſo how <hi>Quintin</hi> an Heretike vſed the Apoſtles with lewd termes. But we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Quintin,</hi> as we doe <hi>Kelliſon.</hi> Thirdly he ſayth, <hi>that <hi>Caluin</hi> called Sayntes long eared creatures,</hi> and <hi>Wicleph <hi>called them</hi> ſcurras principis,</hi> and that <hi>Luther <hi>wrote, that euery Miniſters yoake-fellowe may bee as holy, as the Mother of God.</hi>
                  </hi> But theſe are calumniations deuiſed by them, that neither loue Chriſt, nor the profeſſors of the Chriſtian faith. It may be, that <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaid the Papiſtes made them to <hi>haue long eares,</hi> and that <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliph</hi> ſaid they were vſed, as Princes vſhers. But againſt Gods true Saints they neuer opened their mouth, or thought baſely. Further he talketh idely of the Croſſe, of the nayles and Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Saintes. For it is no great ſigne of loue to keepe the inſtruments, which were cauſe of our friends death, and well may Chriſtians deteſt the worſhip of Images, and yet loue the memoriall of holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that either trauailed in ſetting forth the Chriſtian faith, or ſuffered for the ſame. This ſcuruy Surueyor in ſeeking to ſet forth the honor of the Mother of God, and the Saintes; doth moſt ſhamfully abuſe them, endeuoring to prooue, that we loue not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe that we loue not his Mother, nor his Saintes, euen as thoſe <hi>loue not a man, that loue not his Dogge.</hi> and ſo moſt blaſphemoſly he compareth Gods Saintes to Dogges. Much hee talketh of the worſhip of Saintes, and their reliques, after the Popiſh manner. But if he were the man he would be taken for; he ſhould leaue his vagrant ſcurueying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, and prooue the ſame with arguments. That hee will be able to doe it, wee haue cauſe to ſuſpect, ſeeing &amp; feeling his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this kinde.</p>

                  </hi> hee ſaith <hi>the Saintes ſee and knowe euen our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations and prayers.</hi> But that is as much, as if he ſhould make them Gods. For to God alone it belongeth to ſearch the hearts. He telleth vs alſo, how <hi>they ſee all in the face of God.</hi> But then
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:177778:43"/> they muſt comprehend Gods infinite eſſence, which implyeth a contradiction.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee our Doctrine concerning <hi>Chriſtes</hi> perſon, and nature cleared. But the wicked Doctrine of Papiſtes concerning not only the ſame articles, but alſo his office, and the partes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, neither ſhall <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> nor all his conſortes be able to cleare or defend.</p>

                  </hi> But his antecedent is falſe. For if by Prieſtes hee meane true Biſhops and Paſtors, that truely preach the word, and ſincerelie adminiſter the holy Sacraments according to Chriſt his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; then haue wee ſuch. Neyther is it materiall, that they haue no ordination from the Pope, nor offer ſacrifice for quicke and dead. For neither are the Popiſh ſacrificing ſhauelinges true Prieſtes, nor haue they any good ordination being authorized ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Pope, that is a lay man, or by Abbots, that haue no right to ordeine Miniſters, or by ſuch as haue their ordination from the Pope, who is a mere vſurper of Epiſcopall authoritye. That they are not true Prieſts, it appeareth both by their defect of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177778:47"/> ordination, and alſo by the falſe title of their office, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſacrifice for quick and dead. The ſcriptures ſpeake often of Prieſtes or Elders. So likewiſe do the Fathers. But they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch, as preach the word, and adminiſter the ſacraments, and not ſacrificing ſhauelinges offring for quicke and dead. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may anſwer, that for ſometime, and in ſome places Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may conſiſt without ordinary paſtors, &amp; verie well without Popiſh-prieſtes. This diſcourſe therefore is all for vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Kelliſons</hi> ſhauen crowne, and idolatrous Prieſt-hood.</p>
               <p>His ſecond bolt is leuelled at our religion very lewdly.

But it ſtriketh the Maſſing Religion deadly. For if there be no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where there is no reall and externall ſacrifice; then haue the Papiſtes no Religion. And that is prooued firſt by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wordes <hi>Lib. <hi>1.</hi> de miſſa cap. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> Where he ſayth, <hi>that in a true ſacrifice offered to God, it is required, that the thing offered be deſtroyed.</hi> If then they offer vp <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body and blood in their Maſſe; then do they conſume and deſtroy the ſame, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward leaue themſelues nothing to offer. Secondly that ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body and blood within the accidents of bread &amp; wine, which the Maſſe-prieſtes offer for quicke and dead, as they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is a mere fancy and imagination of theirs contradicting <hi>Chriſt</hi> his inſtitution of the Euchariſt, and diuers other places of Scriptures. They alledge, I confeſſe, ſome words of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Euchariſt, and that which <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaketh of the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice, and <hi>Malachy</hi> of the <hi>cleane oblation.</hi> But they fit not the impure Maſſe, nor the Idolatrous ſacrifice of <hi>Baals</hi> prieſts deſtroying <hi>Chriſtes</hi> inſtitution, and offring that, which hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded not to be offered, but to bee receiued in remembrance of his death and Paſſion. The Fathers alſo were ignorant of the hiſtrionicall ſacrifice of the Maſſe-prieſtes. Neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine Law or Doctrine eſtabliſhed for it before the wicked conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> had enacted their ſacrificing Lawes. All which is prooued in my Bookes <hi>de miſſa</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which this <hi>K.</hi> doth not make any haſt to anſwer.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177778:48"/> his blood at his laſt Supper.</hi> For then hee ſhould haue offered a <hi>bloody ſacrifice</hi> at his laſt Supper, and powred out his blood twiſe. To conclude, where he thinketh to commend vnto vs his maſſing ſacrifice, he ſheweth that Popiſh religion is nothing, but mere nouelties and fooleries ſurpaſſing the reach of common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>His third bolt is thus formed <hi>Lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>3. they haue noe certentie of Sacraments at all:</hi> ergo <hi>no Religion.</hi>
                  </hi> And to prooue his antecedent he ſayth, <hi>that if any will forſake the Catholique Church and her beleife of ſeuen Sacraments, that hee hath no morrall nor probable aſſurance of any Sacraments.</hi> But <hi>firſt</hi> we deny, that the particuler Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Catholique Church. <hi>Secondly</hi> we affirme, that the Catholike Church for a thouſand yeares did neuer heare of <hi>7. Sacraments,</hi> onely and properly ſo called. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it is abſurd to thinke, that the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of confirmation, and extreme vnction did aſwell proceed from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Baptiſme and the Lordes Supper, or that they worke like effectes. Matrimony, orders and repentance we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe haue their originall from God: but neuer as Sacraments of the new Teſtament. For they were in vſe before <hi>Chriſtes</hi> time, and want both formes of wordes, and certaine ſignes, and promiſes annexed to ſignes: all which are neceſſarily required in true Sacramentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Kelliſon</hi> braggeth of proofes of Scriptures and Fathers for all matters. But where are they? we can ſee none brought by him. Nay his Maiſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath bewrayed the pouerty of his cauſe in this behalfe, to no little diſcredit of himſelfe, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his conſortes. If then they haue eyther no Religion, or a graceleſſe Religion, that haue no aſſurance of ſeuen Sacraments, as this <hi>K.</hi> confeſſeth; then is <hi>Kelliſon</hi> and his company left either without Religion, or with a graceleſſe Religion.</p>
               <p>Onely this is his comfort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we haue no graceful religion, yet he hath a greaſie Religion, and hopeth to be iuſtified partly by the greaſing of his handes &amp; ſhauen crowne, and partly by extreme vnction beeing well greaſed departing out of the world, that hee may burne like a candle in purgatorie, and ſlippe like an Eele out the gripes of Lucifer.</p>
               <p>The fourth bolt is thus framed by this fooliſh ſurueying fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>They detract from the dignitie of Sacraments, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:177778:48"/> litle vnto them. <hi>Ergo</hi> they haue no Religion, or a graceleſſe</hi> religion. But how doth hee prooue, that we diminiſh the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Sacraments, or attribute leſſe vnto them, then is due? hee alleadgeth, how ſome call them badges or ſignes, and ſaith, that <hi>we deny that they giue grace, or effectuate any iote of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in our ſoules more then the Sacraments of the olde law did.</hi> But firſt no man among vs, will ſay, or euer did ſay, that they ſerue <hi>onely for ſignes or badges of Chriſtianitie,</hi> and haue no other vſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we all confeſſe, that God worketh ſanctification by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacraments of the new teſtament, albeit Gods power is not ſo tyed to ſacraments, as the Papiſtes teach, who affirme, <hi>that they conteine grace,</hi> and giue that to the ſigne, that is properly wrought and effected by Gods grace. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> wee teach, that the Sacraments of the new Teſtament are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of things paſſed and exhibited, as the ſacraments of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> lawe were of things future; yet we deny not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God wrought grace by them, as hee dooth by theſe. And this is conſonant both to holy Scriptures and fathers. Finally wee doe not derogate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from true Sacraments, that by the word of God is due vnto them, albeit wee preferre baptiſme and the Lordes Supper before the pretended Sacramentes deuiſed by the aduerſaries. But if thoſe haue no Religion, that detract from the Sacraments, then haue Papiſtes but a poore religion, which rebaptiſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thoſe which are by vs baptiſed, and in liewe of the holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt haue thruſt into the Church the idole of the maſſe. They haue alſo corrupted the Doctrine both of repentance, &amp; of orders, making their auriculer confeſſion and humane abſolutions and ſatiſfactions parts of penance contrarie to all antiquitie, and reor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining thoſe that are duelye ordered by vs. Finallye they make their Preeſtes, and Monks, and Fryars, to forſweare marriage. and ſeparate married folkes for Religion, violating the rites of their owne pretended Sacraments.</p>

The which appeareth in that they haue thruſt in theſe wordes <hi>&amp; aeterni,</hi> and <hi>myſterium fidei,</hi> into <hi>Chriſtes</hi> wordes, in the inſtitution of the Cuppe, and haue added to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, <hi>ſalte, ſpittle,</hi> and other elements, and taken away the Cup from the communicates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> alſo with all his might defendeth the integritie of <hi>Chriſts</hi> inſtitution both concerning the wordes and elements of the ſacraments, &amp; neuer called <hi>Chriſtes</hi> words <hi>magical charmes,</hi> albeit the Papiſts with wordes, and a puffe of winde, as with a charme thinke to tranſubſtantiate bread &amp; wine into the Lordes bodie and blood.</p>

That the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177778:49"/> Children of the reprobate are not to be baptiſed, or that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithfull neede not to bee baptized <hi>Caluin</hi> neuer ſayd, nor thought. Neither dooth hee ſay, that wee receiue bare ſignes in the Lords ſupper, but the communion of the body and blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If then this ſurueyor would haue ſet downe theſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mens wordes truelye, then ſhould hee haue had no reaſon to charge them with taking away the Sacraments, or derogating from them.</p>
               <p>But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes, while they depend wholy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the préeſts inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and chop and change wordes in the holy inſtitution, and take away, not onely the ſubſtance of bread and wine, but alſo the Cup from the communicantes, doe indeede depriue Chriſtians of the Sacraments. <hi>Thomas Aquinas <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 66.</hi> ſaith <hi>that baptiſme may bee adminiſtred, <hi>in lixinio,</hi>
                  </hi> that is <hi>in lye,</hi> and <hi>Albertus,</hi> in <hi>Brodio,</hi> that is, <hi>in pottage. <hi>Dionyſius Carth. in</hi> 4. <hi>ſent. diſt.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 2.</hi> ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our <hi>Ladies name may be added to the name of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and <hi>yet all remaine good. <hi>Poteſt in inuocatione beatae mariae fieri baptiſmus cum inuocatione Trinitatis.</hi>
                  </hi> Finally, they teach, <hi>that Dogs &amp; Hogs may eate the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Euchariſt,</hi> &amp; vſe to baptiſe belles.

               <p>His ſixt and laſt bolt is directed againſt the Liturgie and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church. But as in other places ſo heere alſo the man ſhooteth at rouers, ranging vp and downe in an idle and tedious diſcourſe concerning the excellency of prayer, which no man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in queſtion. But that which in the title of his Chapter hee propoſeth to himſelfe, hee forgetteth, and cannot prooue <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>eyther wee haue no prayer,</hi> or <hi>elſe diſorders in prayer.</hi> Hee is not aſhamed to affirme, <hi>that wee haue no prayers at al on wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king daies.</hi> But that is confuted both by common experience and the publike orders of the Church. <hi>On Holy daies,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>we ſpend our time in yelling out <hi>Geneua</hi> Pſalmes.</hi> So the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill teacheth him to yell out blaſphemyes againſt the prayſes of God in Pſalmes, tranſlated out of holy Scriptures. And why thinke you? forſooth becauſe wee admit not the filthie idolatrous prayers of the Maſſe, and breuiaries, and for that alſo wee pray in tongues vnderſtood, and with our ſpirit, and vnderſtanding, and for that we vſe not their <hi>Baals</hi> ſongs. But when Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how Papiſtes pray like Parrats, not vnderſtanding what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177778:50"/> they ſay, and ſing their monkiſh Hymmes, &amp; call vpon they knowe not whome, and ſend vp their prayers before ſtockes and ſtones; they haue no occaſion, eyther to miſlike our Prayers or Pſalmes, or to allow their owne. Neither is it materiall, that wee beleeue not, <hi>that Prayers merit heauen,</hi> or ſatiſfye for our ſinnes, or that man naturally hath <hi>liberum arbitrium</hi> both in knowing and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thinges pleaſing to God. For albeit they merit not, yet they both obtaine thinges neceſſarie, and remooue thinges hurtfull. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, albeit wee cannot ſatiſfye for our ſinnes by prayers, yet by them we obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes, for which our Sauiour hath ſufficiently ſatiſfyed. Finally albeit the natural man by freewil and nature dooth neither vnderſtand the thinges of God, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after thinges pleaſing to God; yet directed by Gods holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by prayers wee obtaine Gods grace, that both enlightneth our vnderſtanding, and helpeth our weakenes. So in all theſe caſes prayer is profitable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore albeit wee teach, that man is iuſtified by faith, and that euerie true Chriſtian led by Gods ſpirit, is to aſſure him ſelfe of Gods fauour; yet are wee not to neglect the meanes, nor to contemne Prayers which are exerciſes of our faith, and helpe to confirme vs, and are meanes to obtaine thinges neceſſarie for vs. The Surueyor therefore that concludeth againſt the meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee aſſure our ſelues of the end promiſed vnto vs through <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> is but an ideot diſputer. For albeit wee hope to attaine to the end; yet wee doe not deny ordinarie meanes.</p>

But firſt wee are vniuſtly charged with euery priuate mans opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: neither will our aduerſaries thinke it reaſon, in their owne caſe to bee ſo vſed.

                  </hi> he teacheth, <hi>that God is author of no wickedneſſe.</hi> Falſely alſo dooth he charge <hi>Caluin</hi> to ſay, <hi>that God not onely foreſeeth mans ſinnes, but hath created him of determinate purpoſe to that end.</hi> Hee ſaith onely, that God dooth not onely permit men to doe what they will, but dooth gouerne their actions, and direct them to ſuch endes, as he appointeth, not that he willeth or acteth their ſinne, or the obliquity of the action, but that he directeth their wicked actions to good endes, which is the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine <hi>in enchiridio ad Laurentium,</hi>
                  </hi> and diuers other places. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi> alſo is moſte wickedly ſlaundered by this falſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fellow, for he hath no ſuch wordes, as thoſe, wherewith hee ſtandeth charged. Neither may we doubt, but this fellowe, that hath ſuch leyſure to prye into all mens faults, wold haue ſet down <hi>Bezaes</hi> wordes, and any thing writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or taught by vs, if the ſame had made for his purpoſe. Wherefore ſeeing this <hi>K.</hi> ſetteth downe his owne malicious ſlaunders, and not our words, he may, if he finde anye inconuenience or abſurditie redounding thereof,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177778:51"/> take the ſame wholy to himſelfe, and not impute it to vs. He may alſo forbeare to prooue, that God is not the author of ſinne. For vnleſſe himſelfe haue any ſuch wicked conceite, we know no man, that will maintaine any ſuch blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>In his ſecond Chapter of his fift Booke hee chargeth <hi>Caluin</hi> further with teaching, <hi>that Gods will and power doth ſo domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere ouer the wil of a ſinner, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſiſt Gods motion, which eggeth &amp; vrgeth him to ſin.</hi> Matters vtterly falſe &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. For proofe hee citeth <hi>Lib. <hi>3.</hi> inſtit. c. <hi>21. 6.</hi> et <hi>8.</hi>
                  </hi> But there is no ſuch matter to be found in thoſe places. There alſo he is charged to ſay, <hi>that Gods will is a neceſſity of things.</hi> But neither doth he ſay any ſuch thing in that place; nor if hee ſhould ſay, <hi>that Gods abſolute wil doth impoſe a neceſſitie of thinges,</hi> doth it followe, that <hi>God doth egge and vrge men to ſinne.</hi> It appeareth therfore that this lying companion ſought not to finde out truth, but to oppreſſe truth, and the fauorers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with lyes and ſlaunders deuiſed by himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly he ſuppoſeth, that we teach, <hi>that Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are impoſſible, and that a man can as ſoone touch the heauens with his finger, as fullfill the leaſt commaundement.</hi> But this is ſo groſſe a lye, as a man may almoſt touch it with his finger. For although we beleeue, that noe man in this frailty of our nature, after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is able perfectly to fulfill the whole Law of God; yet abſolutely and ſimply no man teacheth them to be impoſſible. Nay we know they were poſſible to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocencie, and that now by grace many commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demets may be performed. But ſuppoſe we ſhould ſay, that the Law cannot perfectly bee performed, yet ſhould wee ſay no more, then <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> do teach in <hi>Galat. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> in <hi>Gal. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Bernard <hi>ſerm.</hi> 50. <hi>in cant.</hi>

                  </hi> He wold prooue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of God are eaſie and light. But therin he ſheweth his owne light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that condemneth himſelfe for not performing that, which he taketh to be light. The reſt of his illations are meere fooleryes grounded vpon his owne fancyes.</p>
               <p>In his fourth Chapter he would inferre <hi>that wee make God a moſt cruell Tyrant,</hi> becauſe we teach, that no man is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the whole Law of God perfectly. But his inference is moſt wicked and blaſphemous, and could not proceede, but out of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177778:51"/> blaſphemous thoughts of a wicked Maſſe-prieſt. Out of our Doctrine no ſuch matter is to bee inferred. For as in matter of debts, the Creditor may iuſtly exact his owne, the Debtor hauing bound himſelfe to pay, and after proouing vnſufficient &amp; vnable; ſo man is iuſtly punniſhed for not paying his debt, whereto he is bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; which by his owne fault he is made vnable to pay. <hi>Luther <hi>de ſeruo arb.</hi>
                  </hi> confeſſeth, that in this obſcure light of nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of vnderſtanding man cannot ſee, why God ſhould not bee vniuſt condemning him, that cannot chuſe but ſinne. But yet he accuſeth not God <hi>eyther of injuſtice or cruelty,</hi> as this man would haue it, but rather accuſeth man of blindeneſſe and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And yet others do plainly ſee, that God doth moſt iuſtly exact that at the hande of man, which by his owne default hee is become vnable to performe.</p>
               <p>Finally he chargeth the reformers, <hi>that they pul down the true God out of his throne, and place an Idole in the ſame of their owne imagination.</hi> And his reaſon is firſt, <hi>for that all Heretiks are Idolaters;</hi> and next for <hi>that we hold, that God is the author of ſinne, and of a bad nature, vnreaſonable, and cruell.</hi> But if all Heretikes be Idolaters; then as the Papiſtes are groſſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, ſo are they groſſe Idolaters, holding diuers bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian, Carpocratian, Collyridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Angelican, Manichean, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian</hi> Hereſie, and of diuers other damned Hereſies. Againe if all Idolaters pull God out of his Throne; then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſtes that giue Gods honor to creatures, &amp; worſhip the Sacrament, ſtockes and ſtones Idolatroſly, do pull God, as much as in them lyeth, out of his Throne. Finally if we haue cleared our ſelues from all the iniuſt imputations of this Sycophant, and ſhewed, that neither <hi>Caluin,</hi> nor any of our teachers do hold, that God is author of ſinne, or guilty of any iniuſtice; then I hope the very Papiſtes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-ſelues wil be aſhamed to heare ſuch blaſphemous termes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their teachers, &amp; bee more wary hereafter, how they giue eare to our aduerſaryes clamours. It is one thinge to crye loud, and another thing to bring ſound proofe. Sycophants obiect great crimes: but wiſe Iudges proceed according to proofes.</p>

And yet, as if the Doctrine of Popery, were cleare in this poynt, this <hi>K.</hi> bluſheth not to obiect the faultes of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortes to vs. Like vnto <hi>Parmenian</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt, <hi>who when hee might bee aſhamed of his owne faultes, yet bluſhed not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe innocent Catholiques.</hi> Cum pro tuis erubeſcere debueras,</hi> ſaith <hi>Optatus</hi> to <hi>Parmenian, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contr. Parmen. catholicos innocentes accuſas.</hi>
                  </hi> The difference betwixt our Doctrine and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in this point is very great. We ſay, it is not lawfull for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubiect to lay violent handes vpon their annoynted Kinges. The Papiſtes are taught to rebell againſt Kinges excommunicat by the Pope. Nay <hi>Pius the fift <hi>in bulla contr. Elizahetha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi>
                  </hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, that would not ſtirre againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and take armes againſt her.</p>
               <p>Secondly we ſay, that the King is not ſubiect to any forraine Potentate. They hold, that it is neceſſary to ſaluation for the King of <hi>England</hi> to be ſubiect to the Pope, and thinke men bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it. Nay they ſay the Pope is as farre aboue the Emperour, as the Sunne aboue the Moone.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we ſay, that the Kinges Lawes concerning Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall matters are to be obeyed. The Papiſtes giue all power in Eccleſiaſticall affaires to the Pope, and ſay that the King therin is but an vſurper.</p>
               <p>Fourthly we ſay, that not only lay-men, but alſo all Maſſe-prieſtes, Monkes, and Fryers, ought to be ſubiect to the Prince. Theſe fellowes exempt their Clergie and their goods from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:177778:52"/> gouernement, as appeareth by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> treatiſe <hi>de exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Clericorum,</hi> and diuers decrees of Popes.</p>
               <p>Finally we make Princes and Kinges, ſoueraigne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ouer their ſubiects, and immediate exequutors of Gods lawes. Contrariwiſe the papiſtes make them moſt baſe exequutioners of the Popes Lawes, and therein preuaile ſo farre, that they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet Princes together by the eares one with another, but make them the Popes hangmen, and force them to perſecute their owne innocent ſubiects, if they wil not admit the Popes Idolatrous, and Hereticall Religion.</p>
               <p>But ſaith <hi>Kelliſon <hi>Lib.</hi> 6 <hi>c.</hi> 1. they teach, that no Prince can binde a man in conſcience to obey his Lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and giue ſubjectes good leaue to rebell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolte.</hi> This he ſayth, and how prooueth he that, which hee ſaith? forſooth ſaith he, <hi>Luther <hi>exhorted the</hi> Germaines <hi>not to take Armes againſt the</hi> Turke. <hi>And in his Booke againſt the King of</hi> England <hi>called him all to naught.</hi>
                  </hi> Secondly he telleth vs of the Rebellion of the Boores in <hi>Germanie.</hi> Thirdly he citeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine places out of <hi>Luther,</hi> ſhewing, that the Popes lawes, or Princes poſitiue lawes binde not to mortall ſin, nor rule the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Laſtly he ſpendeth much idle talke about the tumults in <hi>France, Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> But firſt what maketh all this to lawes binding in conſcience? Secondly the Articles of his accuſation containe manifeſt vntruthes. For neither doe wee giue ſubiectes leaue to reuolt, neither doe wee deny that Princes lawes doe binde in conſcience, as oft as they commaund any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in Gods word, or prohibite thinges by God prohibited. If <hi>Luther</hi> reſpected not the Pope, nor his decretale lawes; it is no maruell, ſeeing hee is no lawfull Prince, but an Vſurper, and the head and maintayner of <hi>Antichriſtes</hi> Kingdome. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more where hee and <hi>Caluin</hi> defend Chriſtian mens libertye, as touching their conſcience, they ſay no other thing, then that which they haue learned, and which euerie man may gather out of <hi>Saint Iames <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</hi> where hee ſayth, <hi>there is owne Law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that can ſaue and deſtroy.</hi> As for <hi>Kelliſons</hi> proofes they are eyther grounded vpon falſe reports; or elſe containe matters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. <hi>Firſt</hi> falſe it is, <hi>that Luther exhorted the <hi>Germains</hi> not to take armes againſt the Turke.</hi> Nay hee rather encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177778:53"/> them to defend their countrie againſt the <hi>Turke,</hi> onely ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that if they meant to preuaile againſt him, they muſt firſt correct their liues, and reforme their errors in Religion. But whatſoeuer he ſaid in this argument, it concerneth this matter in queſtion, nothing. <hi>Secondly,</hi> hee was not King <hi>Henries</hi> ſubiect, but dealt againſt him more freely, as being by ſubtiltie of Papiſts ſet foorth to countenance the Popes leud cauſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not the Rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ruſtical Boores in <hi>Germany,</hi> neyther did <hi>Luther</hi> ſpare to reprooue them, and to write againſt them. Beſide that, the cauſe of their inſurrection was not Religion, but temporall oppreſſion. <hi>Fourthly</hi> wee haue before declared what is <hi>Luthers</hi> &amp; <hi>Caluins</hi> meaning concerning the binding of mens conſciences. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> the <hi>Germains</hi> and States of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are well able to cleare themſelues from all blot of rebellion, or imputation laid vpon them by this ſycophant, as may appeare to any that will reade their defences. Finally the Chriſtians in <hi>France</hi> neuer rebelled, but onely tooke armes in defence of their liues, againſt ſuch as broke the Kings edictes, and therefore haue beene iuſtifyed in their actions by the Kings themſelues, and by their edictes at diuers times. Wherfore ſeeing their owne Kings did cleare them; this ſwad hath no reaſon to accuſe them.</p>
               <p>In his ſecond Chapter of his ſixt booke he chargeth vs, <hi>that our Doctrine dooth bring iudges and tribunall ſeates into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</hi> And his reaſon is partlye, for that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> teach, that the poſitiue lawes of Princes bind not in conſcience, and partlye for that they doe condemne the Popiſh Doctrine of freewill. But his reaſon is ſo ſimple and ſoppiſh, that it falleth of it ſelfe without our helpe. For albeit the poſitiue lawes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that haue no ſtrength of Gods lawe, doe not reach ſo farre, as to binde the conſcience; yet all the lawes of Princes, that haue their ground in Gods law doe binde the conſcience alſo. Likewiſe the authoritie of Princes is of God, and therefore no man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without offence of conſcience. Furthermore albeit poſitiue lawes of Princes binde not in conſcience; yet they doe bind men to ſuſteine the puniſhment inflicted by Princes lawes not direct contrarie to Gods lawes. Finally albeit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue not freewil after the opinion of the Papiſts in diſcerning ſpirituall matters, and dooing works pleaſing to God, &amp; tending to the ateining of eternal life; yet he hath freewill to doe lewdly, and therefore iuſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177778:53"/> to be puniſhed. This fellow therefore rather deſerueth to bee puniſhed, that vnderſtandeth our cauſe no better, then admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for his profound ſophiſtrie. He addeth, <hi>that it followeth by the Doctrine of theſe nouuellants, that Princes haue no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to commaund.</hi> But then theſe olde hacſters muſt bring in new &amp; ſtrange concluſions. For as wee haue before declared, wee maintaine the Princes authoritie againſt the vſurpation of the Pope, and obey his lawes better then Papiſtes, who for a long time haue ſtood for the Pope againſt their Princes, both in <hi>France</hi> and other places. <hi>Kelliſon</hi> like an old ſycophant may therefore doe well, ſeeing the Popes tyrannie is ſo newe, to abſtaine from charging others with noueltie, and forbearing to rayle and lye, to produce ſome better arguments.</p>
               <p>In the third chapter of his ſixt booke hee concludeth, <hi>that wee bring Princes lawes into contempt,</hi> and in the fourth and laſt Chapter, that by our Doctrine, <hi>neither the Prince is to rely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his Subjects, nor Subiects vpon the Prince, nor one vpon another:</hi> And all this becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> teach, that Princes meere poſitiue lawes doe not binde in conſcience. But as leapers, that miſtake their riſing fall oft in the midſt, ſo diſputers fayling in their groundes come ſhort of their concluſion. This poſition of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> I haue heeretofore ſhewed to haue beene quite miſtaken by <hi>Kelliſon.</hi> But had they taught ſo as he imagineth; yet doe they neither bring lawes into conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, nor breed any diſtruſt or euil correſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dence betwixt Princes &amp; ſubiects. For al Gods lawes binde in conſcience, &amp; mans lawes as farre as they haue vigor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods law. The authority of Princes is grounded vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law of God. From the ſame alſo not onely our duty tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards our parents, but alſo of huſbands to their wiues, &amp; wiues to their huſbands, of children to their parents, &amp; contrarywiſe for the moſte part receiueth ſtrength. Finally the ſame authoriſeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers contracts willing vs ſo to doe to others, as wee would haue others to doe to vs. Furthermore beſide matter of conſcience, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill lawes doe ſufficiently keepe themſelues from contempt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſortes of ciuill puniſhments. His frappling out-courſes therefore touch vs nothing. But admitte once the wicked and damnable doctrine of Poperye, and giue the Pope leaue to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Princes; then ſubiects are aſſoyled from their fealtie and obedience, oathes are broken, lawes are trodden vnder feet, Kings
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177778:54"/> are murthered and impoyſoned, rebellions are rayſed, lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts are broken, the Father betrayeth his Children, and ſetteth fire to them, as hath been ſeene by practiſe where Popery beareth ſway, and the like doe the Children to their Parents. Finally all lawfull contracts are diſſolued, and al iuſtice is baniſhed. And this we can prooue by diuers practiſes of the Pope and his adherents in <hi>England, Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Heerein wee haue alſo great aduantage of the Papiſtes. Wee follow Gods eternall word, that is a lanterne to our feete, and a light to our pathes; they followe obſcure and vnwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Wee ground our doctrine vpon the Apoſtles and Prophets, that were moſte holy men: they follow the decretales of moſte wicked and impure Popes. Wee propoſe to our ſelues the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his holy Apoſtles: they followe <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the founders of diuers orders of Monkes and Fryars, and No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, who were rather ſuperſtitious, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> zealous, ceremonious, then holy and Religious. Wee puniſh adulterie in moſte places with death, and fornication with ſhame &amp; reproach; neither doe we admitte publike bordels: they count fornication and adulterie ſmall faultes, and maintaine in all great cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> and moſte Countries ſubiect to the Pope common bordel houſes, whereby greate occaſion of corruption of manners is offered to youth, and great offence to Infidels and weake Chriſtians. Wee force none to forſweare marriage: the Papiſts ſuffer neither Monkes, Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, Nonnes, nor Maſſe-prieſtes to marrie; whereof many horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinnes and abhominations follow. We diſpenſe neither with oathes nor promiſes, nor diſſolue contracts: the Pope taketh on him to doe all this, whereby great occaſions are offered of periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and peruerſe dealing. Wée ſet vp no bankes of vſurie: they commonly ſet vp bankes of vſurie, and call them ſometime <hi>banks of pittie,</hi> becauſe men borrow vpon leſſe intereſt, then of common-bankers. Wee fuffer neither <hi>Iewes</hi> nor <hi>Marans</hi> among vs: they admitte both, and take tribute of them, to the great ſcandale of Religion. We count it a thing abhominable, for men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianitie to empoyſon and murder thoſe, that are oppoſite to them in Religion: the Pope and his adherents count ſuch mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and empoyſonments meritorious, and honor the aſſaſſiners, as Saints, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Iames Clement, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parry, Ghineard, Caſtel</hi> and ſuch like.

We allow no indulgences of Popes, that remit, as they ſay. temporall puniſhments; they beeing confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon the Popes indulgences commit groſſe offences.

                  <hi>Kelliſons</hi> diſcourſe therefore concerning vertues, which are ſo rare among the Papiſtes; and of vices, that ſo ſwarme amongſt them, was vnreaſonably inſerted in his <hi>Suruey.</hi> Againſt our Doctrine, certes, iuſtly he can take no exception. In the title of the firſt Chapter of his <hi>7.</hi> Booke, he chargeth vs <hi>with taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hope of Heauen and feare of Hell.</hi> But when hee ſhould bring his proofes, hee alledgeth only a broken ſentence or two out of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin,</hi> which notwithſtanding being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe, do make nothing for him. For neither doth <hi>Caluin</hi> deny, that men ought to doe well for hope of reward, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the humor of thoſe, that reſpect only reward, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els were to moue men to doe good: nor doth <hi>Luther</hi> miſlike, that man ſhould feare Hell, but that Chriſtians ſhould not bee mooued for other cauſes to refraine from euill, then for feare of Hell. But what is this to vs, if aduantage might be taken of ſome wordes of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Caluin?</hi> Further he runneth backe to talke of Lawes poſitiue not binding in conſcience, moſt falſly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all colour, charging vs with taking away all feare of Lawes. The reſt of his firſt Chapter of his <hi>7.</hi> Book is nothing but a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging diſcourſe of diuers ſortes of feare, and of the effects of the hope of reward and feare of puniſhment, which in <hi>Doway</hi> might paſſe for a peece of a Schoole-boyes declamation, but here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of place, and being not gaynſaid ſhall paſſe, as do the reſt of his idle declamations, for a peece of pedanticall foolery.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Chapter of the ſame Booke hee maketh a great matter <hi>of faith only juſtifying,</hi> and ſayth that <hi>therby a gappe is opened to all vice.</hi> But his diſcourſe is ſuch, as rather may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme a ſtage vice, then a Diuine ſpeaking againſt vice.

                  </hi> Neither doth he vnderſtand the works of the ceremoniall Law, or works done by force of free-will. For then he would not haue excluded all the workes of the Law, nor denyed that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iuſtified by workes. Furthermore he would only haue concluded, that man is not iuſtified by the ceremoniall Law or by workes done by the force of free-will without grace. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo <hi>lib. de fid. et oper. c. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </hi> teacheth vs, that man is firſt iuſtified, and then doth good workes. His wordes ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of good works are theſe: <hi>ſequuntur iuſtificatum, non praecedunt iuſtificandum. <hi>They follow him that is juſtified, and goe not before in him, that is</hi>
                  </hi> to be iuſtified. As for thoſe Chriſtians, <hi>that turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> ſayth, and the reſt, againſt whome the Apoſtles wrote, they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contemne good workes: a matter much condemne and farre from vs. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> likewiſe &amp; <hi>Eunomius</hi> gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to a diſſolute life, and <hi>Eunomius</hi> promiſing ſaluation to his followers beleeuing only, ſpeaketh not of the true fayth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but of his owne wicked and Hereticall fayth. But <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> neither ſpeake againſt good workes, nor conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne them, nor allow of their opinions, that contemne good workes, but only exclude them from being the cauſe of iuſtification, or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the act of iuſtification before Gods tribunall ſeate. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they exhorte all Chriſtians to good works, and highly prayſe them, as the fruites of our iuſtification, and very acceptable in Gods ſight. And this Doctrine they deuiſed not of their owne brayne, but receiued it from the Apoſtles and the ancient Fathers of the Church. <hi>Cum dicit apoſtolus</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine <hi>de fid. et operib.

               <p>Secondly our aduerſarie telleth vs, <hi>that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> teach, that good-works are mortall ſinnes, and that faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Caluins</hi> opinion is ſinne.</hi> But that is rather a lewd &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tricke to impute that to any, which hee neuer wrote nor thought. Nay it appeareth manifeſtlie, that they teach contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly hee aſketh a queſtion, <hi>where we reade in Scriptures, that only faith juſtifieth.</hi> But this queſtion we haue alredy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared. And now we ſay further, that this is found in all places, where either the Law and works are excluded from cauſing iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or elſe we are ſaid to be iuſtified freely and by grace, or elſe are taught that the iuſt doth liue by fayth. The Apoſtle <hi>Gal. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> ſayth <hi>if juſtice be by the Law, that Chirſt dyed in vaine.</hi> And <hi>Gal. <hi>5.</hi> volentes iuſtificari per legem à gratia exciderunt. <hi>While they ſought for juſtice by the Law, they fell from Chriſt.</hi>
                  </hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our aduerſaries exception of any moment, where hee ſayth <hi>that the workes of the ceremoniall Law, and of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
                  </hi> are only excluded by the words of the Apoſtle. For he doth not onely ſpeake of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but of <hi>Abraham,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was the Father of the faithfull, &amp; denyeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was iuſtified by works. The prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> alſo <hi>Pſal. <hi>32.</hi>
                  </hi> pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth him <hi>bleſſed, to whome God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no ſin.</hi> Which ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not the ceremoniall Law, but the whole Lawe, whoſe tranſgreſſions are imputed to vs. And the Apoſtle generally excludeth all workes for which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is due from iuſtification. <hi>Ei qui operatur merces non imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:177778:56"/> ſecundum gratiam.</hi> He addeth alſo <hi>how fayth may be ſayd to juſtifie.</hi> But he might haue remembred, that here he is no tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, but an aduerſary. We do therfore rather expect arguments, then documents from him. His expoſition of faith iuſtifying as a diſpoſition, or as a worke is farre from truth, and from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle, who excluding our workes placeth our true iuſtification before God in Gods mercy, and <hi>Chriſts</hi> iuſtice made ours by fayth. To conclude this point, ſeeing none are ſaued but ſuch as are iuſtifyed, and none are iuſtifyed by workes of the law, but ſuch as performe the whole law; it is manifeſt that before God, which is ſo iuſt and holy, and leaueth no ſin vnpuniſhed, no ſinner is iuſtified by the workes of the law. If it were otherwiſe, then would it folow, that <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and other great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners tranſgreſſing the law were iuſtified by the law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he ſaith <hi>It is an abſurd hereſie to ſay, that faith ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be without workes.</hi> But if he ſpeake of a true, liuely and iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, he is rather an abſurd heretike, if he ſay, that the ſame may be without good works. The apoſtle ſaith that faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by charity, and that <hi>the iuſt doth liue by faith.</hi> But liuely faith is actiue. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alſo <hi>lib. de fid. et oper. c. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </hi> dooth teſtifie, that true faith cannot bee voide of workes, <hi>fides Chriſti</hi> ſaith he, <hi>fides gratiae Chriſtianae, id eſt ea fides, quae per dilectionem o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratur, poſita in fundamento n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>minem perire permittit.</hi> So it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, it deſerueth not the name of Chriſtian faith, that worketh not by charitie. In this place alſo this <hi>K.</hi> accuſeth <hi>the Lutherans &amp; Caluiniſtes,</hi> as he calleth them, <hi>for their euill life.</hi> But this is onely an ordinarie phraſe of his rayling ſtile. For not thoſe, that exclude workes from cauſing our iuſtification before God, but ſuch as albeit they pretend faith and works, yet neither haue true faith nor good workes, are guiltie of this accuſation. If we pleaſe to parralell thoſe, whome hee calleth <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſtes,</hi> with the Popes, Cardinals, Maſſe-prieſtes and their adherentes, I doubt not, but they will appeare Saintes in the eyes of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent iudges in compariſon of them. If any man elſe doubt, let him reade the actes of the Conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance</hi> againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>23.</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reportes of <hi>Iohn</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

To ſpeake generally there is great difference betwixt the men of <hi>Geneua</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:177778:57"/>
               <p>Finally he concludeth, <hi>if faith onely doe iuſtifie, that if a man retaine faith, all the vilanyes in the world cannot hurt him: &amp; that hee may aſſure himſelfe, he is iuſt,</hi> howſoeuer he liueth. And this hee goeth about to confirme by <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth thus, <hi>Sola fides Chriſti neceſſaria eſt ad ſalutem: cetera om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia liberrimane<expan>

                  </hi> But as his dealings are diſhoneſt, ſo his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion concerning vilanies is moſt vilanous. For albeit we hold, that a Chriſtian man is to be iuſtified by faith alone in <hi>Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus:</hi> yet wee teach alſo, that he abuſeth Gods grace, and deceiueth himſelfe, which walking after the fleſh and not after the Spirit, and liuing looſely and vngodly ſuppoſeth notwithſtanding, that he retayneth true faith. Furthermore none of vs euer taught, that euerie one is preſently iuſtified, that beleeueth himſelfe to bee iuſt as this <hi>K.</hi> boldly auoucheth, but hee that indeede truely beleeueth in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Laſtly this ſycophant dooth moſt vniuſtly wreſt and miſreport <hi>Luthers</hi> words.

And after the former wordes he addeth, that a ſinner looking for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at Gods handes is not to looke vpon his owne workes, but vpon God through Chriſt. Are not theſe fellowes then ſtrange collectors that conclude contrarie to a mans words and meaning, and would make <hi>Luther</hi> a fauorer of licentiouſneſſe of life, and an enemie of good workes, who expreſſely condemneth al wickednes and commendeth good works, detracting nothing from them, but that they doe not iuſtifye before God, but are rather fruites of iuſtification?</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:177778:57"/>
               <p>In the third Chapter hee affirmeth, that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> in <hi>aſſuring men by an aſſured faith of electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, remiſſion of ſinnes, juſtice, and perſeuerance in the ſame looſe the bridle to all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> But had not hee looſed the reines of his malicious tongue, and ſuffered the ſame to range without reſtraint againſt ſuch as defend the truth; he would neuer haue vttered ſo much falſehood and villany againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin.</hi> For they ſay not, <hi>that whatſoeuer mens liues be, they may boldly rely on Chriſt: or elſe, that men beeing clogged with al the ſins of the world are to beleeue, that they are iuſt,</hi> as this ſurueying ſycophant gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out, but rather, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to preſume of his faith or of Gods mercie, or iuſtice without repentance and good life, which are the fruites &amp; markes of a good faith. And <hi>Luther</hi> albeit he ſay <hi>that life cannot be loſt by any ſinnes, vnleſſe a man will not beleeue:</hi> yet hee doth not ſpeake of ſinnes to come, but of ſinnes paſt and doone away by the grace of Chriſt through baptiſme and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Further out of <hi>Luthers</hi> wordes <hi>lib. de capt.

Nay hée ſheweth that good life cannot bee ſeparated from true faith, and neuer ment to diſioyne the faith of the articles of the Creede, from iuſtifying faith, this beeing deriued from that faith. Laſtly albeit Chriſtians being iuſtifyed by faith, hope they ſhall bee ſaued; yet no man euer beleeued, that iuſtification is nothing elſe but an aſſurance that he ſhall bee ſaued, as the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyor ſurmiſeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Page. <hi>540.</hi>
                  </hi> he calleth the faith of a mans owne ſaluation <hi>phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall,</hi> as if the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beleeuing that nothing ſhould ſeparate him from the loue of God were phantaſtical. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore how can a man profeſſe himſelfe a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he beleeue not remiſſion of ſinnes and eternall life? and if he beleeue this, how can hee chuſe but beleeue his owne ſaluation? againe how can we pray without doubting, if we doubt of remiſſion of ſinnes, which wee craue in the Lordes Prayer? finally the Sacraments are ſeales of this aſſurance of ſaluation when they are applyed to euerie particular Chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:177778:58"/>
               <p>His laſt reaſon or rather reaſonleſſe argument to prooue, <hi>that aſſurance of faith bringeth foorth looſeneſſe of life,</hi> is this: <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man,</hi> as hee thinketh, <hi>may apprehend Chriſtes juſtice to bee his, eyther being mooued to ſinne, or being in the act of ſinne.</hi> But this is his owne weake ſurmiſe. For hee that truelye apprehendeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> is clad with his iuſtice, and guided by his grace, and preſerued from ſinning. And he that walloweth in ſin, and yet preſumeth of Chriſtes grace, is not partaker eyther of his grace or iuſtice.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>7.</hi> Booke and <hi>4.</hi> Chapter hee inueigheth againſt vs for teaching <hi>that ſinne is not imputed to a faithfull man.</hi> But all Chriſtians are rather to exclaime againſt him, that beleeueth that ſinnes are neither doone away by repentance, nor purged by faith in Chriſtes blood, but alwaies imputed vnto true beleeuers. To helpe foorth with a bad matter, hee ſaith that <hi>Caluin <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>inſtit. c.</hi> 14.17.</hi> and <hi>chap. <hi>18.8.</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith plainely <hi>that all iuſt and faithfull mens workes are ſinnes.</hi> But this is a plaine lye, and ſheweth that this ſurueyor dooth vſe but little iuſt and plaine dealing. For in thoſe places no ſuch thing is to be found. Nay, it implyeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to bee a good worke, and a ſinne both together. After this hee concludeth, becauſe ſinne is not imputed vnto them that beleeue, <hi>that Chriſtians are not to feare theftes, or adulteryes, or other ſinne.</hi> But his concluſion doth but lewdly follow vpon his premiſſes. For albeit former ſinnes are doone away by true faith and repentance; yet all true Chriſtians beeing once cured are to take heede they ſinne no more. Further repentance bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with it newneſſe of life and a care to auoide ſinne afterward, and not as <hi>K.</hi> ſurmiſeth, a boldneſſe in ſinning.</p>
               <p>The fift Chapter conteineth nothing almoſt but vaine repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and odious calumniations againſt Maiſter <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> and other Godly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>that they condemne the iuſt mans good deedes as mortal ſinnes.</hi> But this hath bin declared to bee a mortall or rather capitall ſlaunder. For althogh they hold, that euen in the workes of good men there are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and that many actes to vs ſeeming good are euill; yet they no where ſay, that the iuſt mans good deedes are mortall ſinnes. in the wordes by <hi>K.</hi> alleadged partially, there is no ſuch matter. Secondly hee chargeth them to teach, <hi>that the faithfull mans euil deedes are good and honeſt.</hi> But therein hee dealeth vnfathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:177778:58"/> and diſhoneſtly. For they doe not diminiſh mens ſinnes, but commend Gods great mercy, that imputeth them not, albeit they be very great and heynous. Thirdly hée affirmeth, that <hi>Caluin</hi> teacheth, <hi>that originall ſinne hath blotted out the image of God in man.</hi> But if all the vntruthes of this ſlauderous Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey, were blotted out, the reſt would ſcarce ſerue to ſtoppe one Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar bottle. <hi>Caluin</hi> ſaith, that the image of God in man is not loſt by his fall, but onely blemiſhed and defaced. The ſame man, where he ſpeaketh of the workes of Infidels ſaith not that all of them are ſinnes, but <hi>that they ſinned all in their morrall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> And this he prooueth out of <hi>Auguſtine <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contr. Iulianum.</hi>
                  </hi> Finally, none of vs teaching, that our will is vnable to performe any good worke tending to the attaining of eternall life, dooth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther teach contrarie to ſcriptures, or ouerthrowe Artes, or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh reaſon, or make all ſinnes equal, albeit this <hi>K.</hi> in his brable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dooth charge vs therewith.</p>
               <p>In the ſixt Chapter he runneth beſide himſelfe, and entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a tedious declaration concerning free-will, and diuers odious repetitions of the ſame matters. But what will you ſay, is this to the purpoſe? Forſooth no more then if hee ſhould tell you what commaund he had in time paſt ouer the Hogſheades in my Lord <hi>Vauxes</hi> Sellar. For we do not deny free-will in all thinges, as did the <hi>Manachees,</hi> who held that ſinne proceeded not from our will, but from the ſubſtance of the euill ſoule, and therfore are iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted by Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke <hi>de duab. anim. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </hi> neither did <hi>Luther</hi> deny free-will ſimply, but only in thinges that concerne the attaining of the Kingdome of heauen. Furthermore neither doth <hi>Luther</hi> teach, <hi>that free-wil goeth neceſſarily that way, which either the ſpirit ſpurreth it, or the Diuell vrgeth it,</hi> as this lewd Sycophant ridden and ſpurred on by no good ſpirit ſhamefully lyeth: nor doth <hi>Caluin</hi> affirme, that Gods prouidence and predeſtination taketh away free-will, as hee deſperatly and imprudently chargeth him: neither do we either teach. that man ſinneth vnwillingly, or deny, that he hath his will free in naturall &amp; ciuill matters. What the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is it that pincheth this thick-ſkind fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? Forſooth becauſe we ſay that the naturall man neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the thinges, that are of God, nor by his free-will is able to performe them. This is it, which the ſemipelagian Papiſtes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and againſt which Doctrine <hi>Kelliſon</hi> marſhalleth all his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:177778:59"/> forces, if ſuch weake ſtuffe at the leaſt, may bee termed forces. And firſt he endeuoreth to prooue <hi>free-will.</hi> But if by this word he vnderſtand only an abilitie &amp; wil to doe wickedly, then we deny not, but ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath free-will. If by free-wil he vnderſtand that will and power in ſpiritual matters and concerning eternal life, which the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> and other Romiſh teachers doe meane; then he may do well to take a larger terme to prooue his Doctrine. That conuenticle <hi>ſeſſ. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>1.</hi> et. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </hi> ſpeaking of free-will in matters concerning eternall life, ſaith, it is only attenuated, and weakned and not extinguiſhed or loſt by the fall of <hi>Adam. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Biel <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>d.</hi> 27. 4.</hi> teacheth. that a man by force of free-will may <hi>remoue the barre</hi> (of Gods grace) <hi>that is mortall ſinne; becauſe hee may ceaſe from the conſent and act of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yea hate ſinne, and frame his will not to commit ſinne. <hi>Homo exiſtens in peccato mortali</hi>
                  </hi> ſaith he, <hi>poteſt remouere obicem, hoe eſt peccatum mortale: quia poteſt ceſſare à conſenſu et actu peccandi, imò odiſſe peccatum, et velle non peccare.</hi> Commonly they hold, that <hi>man in his naturall faculties, was left ſound after the fall; that the will by the force of nature is able to diſpoſe it ſelfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue grace:</hi> that <hi>the ſame is able by the force of nature to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde euery mortall ſinne, and to fulfill the Law of God, as touching the ſubſtance of the act.</hi> But the Scriptures teach vs, that the vnregenerate man is dead, and ſould vnder ſinne. <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</hi> Wee read <hi>that the naturall man vnderſtandeth not the thinges that are of God, and that they are fooliſhneſſe vnto him.</hi> And <hi>2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</hi> that all our ſufficiencie is of God. <hi>Si ad aliquid idonei ſumus, id ex deo eſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Secondly he ſaith <hi>if man haue no free-will, that then all vice may goe for currant.</hi> But if hee meane free-will and the power therof according to the Doctrine of the Papiſtes; then his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion wil not paſſe for currant, nor will his vize-ſhip prooue more vicious holding with vs according to the Doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Fathers, then he now is eſteemed defending the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales of Popes, and Copper Doctrine of Schoole-men.</p>
               <p>The ſeauenth Chapter of his <hi>7.</hi> Booke containeth an inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue againſt vs, as if we taught, that all Gods commaundements are ſimply impoſſible. But heerein it ſeemeth, that wilfully he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The reſt of his ſeauenth Booke is nothing elſe, but a reſt of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling termes, degorged out of his cankerd and malicious ſtomacke, and voyd of truth and proofe. We anſwer therefore breefly, and plainlye to the entent that heerafter hee may bee better enformed concerning our Religion firſt that <hi>Chriſt hath not freed vs from the obedience of Lawes,</hi> and that this is no part of our fayth to hold ſo. Nay we ſay, that faithfull men, as they are freed from the curſe of the Law for their ſinnes, ſo by diuers arguments they are exhorted and ſtirred vp to hearken to the wordes of the Law, and to yeeld their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto it. Secondly we pronounce them <hi>anathema,</hi> that ſhall ſay, <hi>that God is the author of ſinne:</hi> and haue, I truſt, fully diſcharged Maiſter <hi>Caluin</hi> from this moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt imputation. Thirdly we take them to bee brutiſh Heretikes in the forme of men, that doe not diligently diſtinguiſh <hi>betweene vertue and vice.</hi> In our Doctrine there is not the leaſt ſuſpicion of any ſuch matter. Fourthly of conſcience wee ſpeake according to the holy Apoſtle, that groundeth it not vpon the Popes decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, but vpon the Law of God. Fiftly we hate all pride, knowing that humility is the cognizance of Chriſtians, and ground-worke of all vertues. Sixtly wee exhort men to labour diligently in their vocation thinking them vnworthy to eate, that will not worke. Wee exhort all men alſo to doe good workes and that while it is day, becauſe the night commeth when no man can worke; ſo farre are we from allowing idleneſſe. Seuenthly we hold that Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is honorable among all degrees of men, and ſay that God will iudge adulterers and fornicators. We teach chaſtity, wee puniſh vnchaſt and lecherous perſons. Finally our Doctrine doth ſhew the way for ſinners to ariſe, and to be looſed from the bondes of ſinne. What a ſhamleſſe fellow then is this to make theſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines falſely imputed to vs rules of our Religion, when we not only renounce them, but alſo deteſt them, and the reporter of them?</p>

                  </note>But if we looke backe and reflect our eyes vpon the Doctrine and practice of Papiſts, we ſhal then perceiue them to be guilty of that, which they moſt wickedly and ſlaundrouſly impute vnto vs. Firſt as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had freed them from al lawes, ſo they contemne all Lawes. The Pope taketh vppon him not only to diſpence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, and the Law morall, but alſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177778:60"/> to looſe the ſubiectes from the obedience of lawes, &amp; to arme them againſt their Princes. The Maſſe-prieſts and marked ſlaues of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> are exempted from al burthens of Law. And <hi>Emanuel ſa</hi> in his Aphoriſmes ſaith, <hi>that the rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Clerke againſt. his Soueraigne Lord is no treaſon, becauſe he is not his Subject</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> albeit they ſay, that God is not the Author of ſinne, yet they hold, that their idolatrous doctrine of worſhip of Angels, Saintes, and Images, that the rebellious and treacherous pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes of Subiects againſt Princes vpon warrant of the Pope, that the hereticall opinions and traditions of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> which are moſte wicked and ſinfull, are of God. They bluſh not alſo to ſay that the pope &amp; papacy is of God. But he is the man of ſinne, and his ſtate is the Kingdome of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> as if they put no difference betwixt vertue and vice, ſo they chuſe Prelates, Cardinals, Popes indifferentlye, without reſpect to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r pietie, learning, and other good qualities. The Pope he diſpenſeth with all vices, the people liueth moſte beaſtly. <hi>Petrarch</hi> in his Sonnets calleth <hi>Rome Babylon,</hi> in regard of the confuſion there. In his Epiſtles without title ſpeaking of the Popes Court, all goodneſſe, ſaith he, <hi>is there loſt. <hi>Omne ibi bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num perditur.</hi> Bernard <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de conſid.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> hee that ſeeketh for conſcience, muſt neuer hope to finde it among Papiſtes, who making conſcience to worke on a holy day, and to eate fleſh on Frydaies, were nothing ſcrupulous to murder olde and young, men and women, and all ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and without forme of law to kill many thouſands of innocent Chriſtians, as may appeare by the bloody maſſacre of <hi>France An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no <hi>1572.</hi>

                  </hi> and his mates being reſolued to blow vp the vpper houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and to make a generall maſſacre of ſuch as feared God, were abſolued by <hi>Ieſuites</hi> and Maſſe-prieſtes, and promiſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for their good ſeruice. To make a ſomme of all, they make no conſcience to make idoles, and to worſhip them, to violate the Saboth, to rebell againſt Magiſtrates or parents, or to breake any law of God. But to breake the Popes orders, or their owne traditions, they accompt it a matter very heynous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> next to <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Pope excelleth in pride He treadeth on Princes neckes, he giueth his feete to bee kiſſed, hee rideth on mens ſhoulders, he is called a <hi>God on the earth</hi> and vſurpeth his honor. Such alſo are the Prelates and the reſt of the popiſh Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. <hi>Auentinus <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>annal. in praef.</hi>
                  </hi> ſheweth they excell in pride, and with goods giuen to the poore keepe Dogges, Horſes, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. <hi>Pauperum alimentis canes, equos, ſcorta alunt.</hi>

                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> neuer was idleneſſe more in price, then ſince Monkes and Fryars came into the world. They deuoure the fruites of the painefull labour of others, and intend nothing but to eate, drinke, ſleepe and to inioy carnall pleaſures. Of ſuch we may ſay with the Apoſtle. <hi>2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. Hee that laboureth not, let him not eate.</hi>

                  <hi>Seauenthly,</hi> albeit the Maſſe-prieſtes, Monkes, Nonnes and Fryars forſweare marriage; yet not ſect of Religion, or ſtate of men or women is more impure. <hi>Honorius Auguſtodunenſis</hi> ſpeaking of Nunnes, ſaith <hi>they are more common then Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots. <hi>Omnibus fornicarijs peius proſternuntur.</hi>

               <p>Finally, the Doctrine of Popery is a doctrine full of licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> take vpon them to diſpenſe with all ſins and wickednes. Their indulgences as the <hi>Germans Grauam. 3.</hi>

The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> of late abſolued them before hand, which by gun-powder went about to blow vp the Parliament houſe. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mond</hi> the Ieſuite abſolued <hi>Pearcy, Catesby</hi> and their fellowes taking armes againſt their King and Countrie. While men hope to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie for their ſinnes in purgatorie, they deferre repentance to the laſt breath. Their enemies they tye with yron bondes. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> would not releaſe the Emperor, vntill he had trod on his necke with his feete, and vſed him with greate indignities. Contrarywiſe they promiſe heauen to their friends, though laden with greeuous ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. They hold euerie tranſgreſſion of the Popes decretales to bee ſinne. This is therefore a Religion, that both promiſeth reward to cutthroates &amp; greeuous ſinners, and by their indulgences, abſolutions, and fancies of purgatory hold a ſinner ſo faſt bound in ſinne, that there can bee no hope for him, to bee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as long as he followeth their wicked Doctrines. As for <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> they are farre from ſuch wicked courſes. They teach chriſtian liberty. But they extend it not ſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they exempt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans eyther from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of Gods lawes, or mans lawes, but onely from the curſſe of the law, and from humane traditions, that they binde not mens conſciences. They diſtinguiſh <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> And ſo would <hi>Kelliſon</hi> too, but that hee talketh hee knoweth not what. Of <hi>Moyſes</hi> his law they make diuers vſes, and onelye detract from it the effect of iuſtification, and ſaluation by reaſon it accuſeth man of ſinne and is not fulfilled. The Apoſtle alſo teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, if iuſtice were of the law, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had dyed in vaine. Of the author and original of ſinne, and of conſcience, they teach moſt Chriſtianlye, following therein the Doctrine of the Apoſtles and holy Fathers of the church. The pride of the Pope &amp; his adherents they deteſted and refuſed both by wordes and examples; and ſo farre were they from idleneſſe, and allowing of idleneſſe, that they thought him vnworthy to liue or eate, that laboured not in ſome honeſt, and lawfull vocation. Concerning chaſtitie they taught as truely, as the Papiſts wickedly. They ſhewed, that it conſiſted not in forſwearing marriage, but in abſtinence from all filthie
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177778:62"/> thoughtes, actes and ſpeeches. That which ſome impute to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of taking the Mayde, when the wife refuſeth,</hi> is a meere calumniation. He ſheweth onely what ſome doe, or at the leaſt threaten to doe, and not what they ought to doe. Of the degrees of conſanguinitie they teach better then the Pope. They neuer taught, that a man might marrie his brothers wife, or his Neece, or his Siſter, as the Popes haue doone. Finally they hold no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners faſt bound in ſinnes, but ſhew the right way, how to riſe from ſinne, by faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and true repentance, clearing thoſe doubts, which before had entangled many Chriſtian ſoules, and brought them to vtter deſtruction. If then this <hi>K.</hi> had not had his conſcience ſeared, &amp; his eyes ſeeled, and his vnderſtanding darkned in theſe points, he would haue ſeene and acknowledged the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of his owne fellowes Doctrine, and abſtained from accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others.</p>

Next aduanceth creatures to a diuine being. And thirdly commeth neere to <hi>Seruetus</hi> his impiety. For if a creature in God is God, why may not <hi>Kelliſon</hi> alſo ſay, <hi>that God in a ſtone is a ſtone, and in Iron Iron,</hi> as <hi>Seruetus</hi> did, if <hi>Bellarmine <hi>in praefat. ante tom</hi> 1. <hi>diſput.</hi>
                  </hi> ſay truly. Neither can it excuſe him, that God foreſawe and foreknew all thinges, and as Philoſophers ſay, had ideaes in him. For this deuiſe of ideaes is a Philoſophical fancy, and yet cannot make <hi>Kelliſons</hi> aſſertion good, ſeeing the platoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call philoſophers diſtinguiſh ideaes from the thinges them-ſelues and make them ſeparate from them.</p>

                  </hi> But the firſt ſpeech is impious ſeeming to import, that he meaneth to ouercome God, and to confute him, as hee hath alredy endeuored to confute his truth.

                  </hi> he would gladly prooue, that there is a God <hi>by the conuulſions of men poſſeſſed.</hi> And <hi>pag. <hi>650.</hi>
                  </hi> by <hi>Witches.</hi> Hee ſayth alſo, that ſuch as are poſſeſſed by Deuils <hi>ſomtimes howle like Dogges, ſomtime yell like Wolfes.</hi> But his argumentes from <hi>Witches</hi> and poſſeſſed with <hi>Deuils</hi> prooue the Deuill, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then God. Secondly his proofes are weake being drawne rather from illuſions and counterfet trickes, then from matters e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently true. Laſtly it is hard to be beleeued, that he hath heard any, that eyther howled like Dogges, or yelled like Wolfes. Theſe proofes therfore are liker to draw men to infidelitye, then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Afterward he talketh idlely <hi>of the heauy and lumpiſh nature of the earth;</hi> an element, as it ſeemeth predominant in him, <hi>of the Common-wealth of <hi>Bees</hi> ſo well ordered, that a Statiſt may learne policy from it,</hi> as he beleeueth, of the <hi>leapes of <hi>Hares,</hi> of <hi>Foxes</hi> and Fearne buſhes,</hi> of <hi>Spiders and ſpider-webs,</hi> and ſuch like vaine and idle ſimilitudes. But what ſhould I follow or runne after him, that runneth ſo farre not onely from his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but from himſelfe alſo?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond chapters rubrike he affirmeth <hi>that our Doctrine, ruineth al Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But in the Chapter it ſelfe there is no ground brought for proofe of his aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Only in the latter end he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh charge vs with holding, <hi>that God is the author of all ſinne.</hi> And thereof concludeth, that thoſe which beleeue this muſt needes <hi>haue cold hearts in Religion.</hi> But we haue declared his antecedent to be falſe and fantaſticall. What then ſhall we need to beat downe his ruinous conſequent? The reſt of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter containeth diuers poyntes of popiſh Doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Gods true worſhippe, Heretikes and their markes, Chriſtes honor, Prieſtes an ſacrifices, ſucceſſion, vnity, vniuerſality, here idelye repeated, and formerly refuted. <hi>Pag. <hi>671.</hi>
                  </hi> he beareth vs in hand, that the moderne Romiſh Religion is <hi>moſt conformable to the Doctrine planted by the Apoſtles.</hi> But he ſhall not be able to prooue all his life, halfe of that which he hath affirmed in one line. He ſaith, <hi>he hath prooued it in his commentaries <hi>in ſecunda ſecu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
                  </hi> But his proofes are weake, and therefore dare not abide the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177778:64"/> light. If he come forth with his proofes of his Religion heerafter, we will pray him alſo to ſhew, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine of blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp Princes and Parliament-houſes with Gun-powder, of breaking of oathes, of lying and equiuocating, of the Popes vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Monarchye, of kiſſing the Popes Pantoufle, of iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by confirmation, extreme vnction, Mariage, and orders <hi>ex o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere operato,</hi> of taking Chriſt with the teeth, of tranſubſtantiation, halfe communions, priuate Maſſes, prayer in a tongue not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, worſhip of Saintes and Angels, and the reſt of thoſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Hereſies which we refuſe, are conformable to that Religion, which was firſt planted by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>In the third Chapter hee affirmeth, <hi>that in contempt of the Churches authority we bring all Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into contempt.</hi> But how prooueth hee, that wee contemne the Churches authoritie? <hi>Firſt</hi> he ſayth, <hi>it is a maxime, and almoſte an article of fayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs, that the true Church, which once was, hath erred groſſely, and in no leſſe matters, then fayth, juſtification, merit, free-will, workes, ſatisfaction, Purgatory, prayer to Sayntes, worſhip of Images, number &amp; vertue of Sacraments, ſacrifice and ſuch like.</hi> But if hee meane the whole Catholique Church; this is neither article, nor maxime, nor opinion of ours, that <hi>the whole Church hath erred groſſely.</hi> If he meane the Pope, and his adherents, and paraſites, why ſhould not they erre as well, as the Churches of <hi>Antioch, Alexandria, Hieruſalem, <hi>and</hi> Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople?</hi> That they haue indeed erred, we haue already prooued, and offer our ſelues alwayes ready to prooue: and it is moſt apparant, for that their Doctrine is not only diuers, but alſo contrary to the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and namely in the points aboue ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Next hee ſayth <hi>Luther <hi>cared not for a thouſand Churches,</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>Caluin, Beza <hi>and others deſpiſed all the Councels, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers.</hi>
                  </hi> But neyther the contempt of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the reiection of diuers Conuenticles aſſembled by Popes, nor the refuſall of diuers counterfet Bookes alledged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Fathers, or of ſome Fathers ſinguler opinions doth argue anye contempt of the true Church, or of lawfull councelles, or of the authenticall writinges and common Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Fathers. Further, I would haue thought, that reaſon might haue taught him, talking ſo long of Religion, that priuate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177778:64"/> mens ſayinges and opinions ſhould not ſo often haue beene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted generally to vs or to the whole Church.</p>
               <p>To prooue, that contempt of the Churches authoritie bringeth Religion into contempt, hee alleadgeth, <hi>that wee cannot knowe, which is Scripture, which not, but by the voice of the Church.</hi> But firſt this is nothing to vs, which doe much eſteeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Apoſtolike and Catholike Church. We ſay alſo, that euerie priuate man is to reuerence the iudgement of the true Church. But what is this to the Romiſh ſynagogue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not the true church? againe what is this to the Pope, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is an oppreſſor of the church, and an enemie of Chriſtian Religion? if <hi>Kelliſon</hi> wil contend, that the ſentence of the Pope, which neither vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, nor percaſe can reade Scriptures in the originall tongues, muſt needes be followed in deciding the controuerſies about Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical ſcriptures; his owne ſchollers wil laugh at him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh a betilheaded fellow iudge in matters of religion, &amp; a blinde man iudge of colours. If he refer men to the particular church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that now is, it will bee ſaid, that ſhe cannot bee iudge and partye, and that the auncient Church is much to bée preferred before her. Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> wee confeſſe among manye other reaſons was enduced alſo to beleeue by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churches authoritie. So likewiſe are many more then he. But <hi>K.</hi> remooueth all other reaſons and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues in matter of diſcerning ſcriptures, and maketh his moderne Church a neceſſarie cauſe and almoſt ſole motife of faith, as if none were to beleeue eyther ſcriptures, or any other Article of faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee bee reſolued by the Pope, and the moderne Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Blaſphemouſly alſo hee affirmeth, that <hi>the Romaine Church being contemned, wee can no more aſſure a man of Scripture, then of a Robin-hoodes tale.</hi> But to vſe theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons is blaſphemye. To make ſo much of nothing, and to ſtand ſo much vpon a blinde Pope, and to preferre the Romaine moderne Church before the auncient, and all other moderne chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is foolery.</p>
               <p>In the fourth Chapter he beareth his Reader in hand, <hi>that wee reject ſome bookes of Canonicall Scripture,</hi> and for proofe ſaith <hi>that Luther reiected the Booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> Eccleſiaſtes, and all the Goſpels ſaue that of Iohn,</hi> and <hi>that we reiect the Bookes of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith, Tobia, Eccleſiaſticus, Wiſdome,</hi> and the <hi>Machabees.</hi>
                  </hi> But theſe latter Bookes hee ſhall neuer prooue to be canonicall, vnleſſe wée
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177778:65"/> take the Canon largelye, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſometimes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to doe. <hi>S. Hierome <hi>in prol. galeato, Athanaſius in Synopſ. Gregorius Nazianzenus in carminibus, Epiphanius in lib. de pond. &amp; menſur.</hi>
                  </hi> and the moſte and beſt Fathers eſteeme of them no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then we doe. The calumniation concerning <hi>Luther</hi> wee haue anſwered already. But ſaith <hi>K. they will needes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Scripture at the Roman Churches hand.</hi> And of this hee would inferre, that as well we ought to follow that Church in the number of bookes, <hi>as in receiuing canonicall Scripture vpon that Churches warrant.</hi> This ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ith hee, but hee taketh that for graunted, that no man yeeldeth him. For wee take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelfe did, from the Prophets and Apoſtles. We doe alſo aſſure our ſelues, that the iudgement of the Apoſtolike Church is farre to be preferred before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtaticall moderne Romiſh Church. Laſtlye wee anſwere to his argument, that wee haue diuers arguments to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs of the authoritie &amp; truth and number of canonicall bookes of Scriptures, beſide the teſtimony of any one particular Church, as for example the teſtimony of Scripture it ſelfe, the likeneſſe, Maieſtie antiquitie, truth, ſtile of Scripture and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>In the fift chapter he endeuoreth to prooue, <hi>that our diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Religion doe open a gappe to contempt of Religion.</hi> And thereupon talketh his pleaſure of <hi>Caluiniſtes and Luther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Puritanes, Proteſtants, ſoft and rigid Lutherians, Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Bezites, Anabaptiſtes, Libertines, Browniſtes, Martiniſtes, family of loue, and damned crew.</hi> But firſt the damned crew is by vs damned. In this late conſpiracie of Papiſts, <hi>Edward Bayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that is knowne to bee of the damned crewe was choſon for a fit ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goe as <hi>nuntio</hi> from this damned crew to the Pope. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes, Libertines,</hi> &amp; the <hi>family of loue,</hi> are more among the Papiſts, then among vs. We ſay to them <hi>anathema maranatha.</hi> The <hi>Browniſtes</hi> and <hi>Martiniſtes,</hi> wee generally condemne. The reſt are the names of ſlaunder deuiſed by <hi>Papiſtes.</hi> To anſwere his obiection therefore, wee ſay, that the Churches of <hi>Germanye, France,</hi> and other countries doe well agree: and priuate men doe ſubmitte themſelues to the determination of a free generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and in the meane while to their nationall Churches.</p>
               <p>The groundes of his ſixt chapter are laide vpon the Popes head-ſhip. For becauſe <hi>wee want a viſible head, hee ſuppoſeth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177778:65"/> wee giue great aduantage to Atheiſtes.</hi> But as the Popes head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is a matter rather fancied, then prooued out of Scriptures or Fathers; ſo what ſo euer is thereupon built, the ſame is founded vpon fancie, and not worth a head of Garlike. That Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did rule both the Apoſtles and all the church, as <hi>Chriſtes</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car generall, and head of the Church, it cannot bee prooued. All the Apoſtles were called alike, and ſent to teach and adminiſter the Sacraments alike. They had alſo the keyes of the Church giuen to them by one ioynt commiſſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth, that the principall of the Apoſtles gaue vnto him nothing. But had <hi>Peter</hi> had any ſuch monarchy, as is pretended; yet that is nothing for the aduantage of our triple crowned Popes, that are ſo vnlike to <hi>Peter,</hi> and kil Chriſtes ſheep, as he fed them. Nay the auncient Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> neither gaue lawes to the whole church, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained biſhops in all quarters, nor receiued appeales out of al the world, nor reſerued certaine caſes to themſelues, nor practiſed the reſt of the moderne Popes authoritie. But ſaith <hi>K. where a head wanteth, there euerie man may preach, and embrace what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he will.</hi> As if generall and prouinciall councels, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in their Dioceſſes, &amp; Godly Princes in their Kingdomes, were not able to remedy this diſorder. Other meanes certes there was not in the primitiue Church, and he that looketh, that Popes ſhould redreſſe Atheiſme, and other abuſes, is himſelfe much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed.</p>
               <p>In the laſt Chapter hee ſaith, that <hi>denying the reall preſence</hi> (taught by the Popiſh Synagogue) <hi>we ruine Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and call all other myſteries of faith in queſtion.</hi> But his propoſition is moſte falſe, and abſurd. For not thoſe which deny the Cyclopicall eating of Chriſtes fleſh, and the carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence thereof vnder the accidents of bread and wine, but ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as hold that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> fleſh and blood is receiued of reprobats perſons, nay Hogges and Dogges, and is ſwallowed downe into the belly, and deny thinges felt and ſeene, doe bring a ſlaunder vpon Religion, and call all holy myſteries, not onely into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but into contempt alſo. <hi>Auerroes</hi> for this groſſe opinion onely affirmed, that the Religion of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> was of all other moſt ridiculous. For what can bee deuiſed more ridiculous, then to make a God, and to eate him vp preſently? this doctrine of <hi>Papiſts</hi> hath beene a great ſtumbling blocke both to Gentiles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If then <hi>Atheiſme</hi> do ſo raigne in the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> whome the Papiſtes call moſt holy, and honor as the heades and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Church, &amp; ſupreme Iudges of all controuerſies, and are bound to follow, albeit they may lead infinite ſoules to Hell, as it is ſaid in <hi>Chap. <hi>ſi Papa. diſt.</hi> 40.</hi> it is no maruell, although the Maſſe prieſts and their followers be tainted with <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and contempt of Religion. <hi>Machiauell,</hi> whome many <hi>Atheiſts</hi> follow, was no <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> but an <hi>Italian,</hi> and a great friend of <hi>Clement the 7.</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e alſo he dedicated his <hi>Florentine</hi> hiſtorie.

               <p>The<note n="*" place="margin">That the Doctrine of Popery ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme.</note> very doctrine of Popery tendeth to Atheiſme and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God. Generally the lay-people think themſelues ſafe, if
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:177778:68"/> they beleeue, as the Church beleeueth, and ſo <hi>Hoſius</hi> and others teach their Diſciples. But what, I pray you, is this, but Atheiſme for men to be ignorant of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his grace, and of the meanes of their ſaluation, and of Gods true worſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epheſ. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> worſhipping many Gods are ſayd <hi>to be without God in the world.</hi> May not then the ſame be verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Papiſtes, that worſhip ſo many Angels and Saintes, and giue the honor of God to the Sacrament, to the Crucifixe, and the Images of the Trinity?</p>
               <p>Thirdly how can we eſteeme them to haue any feeling of true piety, that ſpeake ſo lewdly of Scriptures? Some call them a <hi>Noſe of Waxe,</hi> ſome <hi>a Ship-mans Hoſe,</hi> ſome <hi>a bare Letter,</hi> ſome <hi>Inky Diuinity,</hi> ſome <hi>a matter of ſtrife,</hi> ſome <hi>the ground of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies. <hi>Kelliſon pag.</hi> 687.</hi> ſaith, <hi>if a man contemne the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> that hee ſhall no more bee able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe of Scripture then of a <hi>Robin Hoodes</hi> tale. <hi>Pag.</hi> 41.</hi> hee ſaith <hi>the Scripture with a falſe meaning is the word of the Deuill.</hi> As if the Scripture being endited by the holy Ghoſt could in any reſpect be called the word of the Deuill. <hi>Pag. <hi>39.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> none but Atheiſtes, and ſuch as ſauour of <hi>Atheiſme</hi> directly violate and impugne Gods commaundements, and make Lawes repugnant vnto them.

God ſayth <hi>thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but me:</hi> the Popiſh faction ſayth contrary, thou ſhalt haue other Gods, commaunding their followers to call vppon Saints and Angels, to worſhip the Sacrament and Crucifixes, to confeſſe their ſinnes, &amp; to offer <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body and blood in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Saintes and Angels. <hi>Turſellinus a <hi>Iebuſite</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond Commaundement we are directly prohibited to make grauen Images, to the intent to bow to them, and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe them. But the Papiſtes haue impiouſly blotted out this commaundement in their ſhort Catechiſmes, &amp; commaund men
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:177778:68"/> vpon paine of death and damnation to fall downe before Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes, and other Images, and to worſhip them ſomtime with <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>latria,</hi> according to the ſubiect.</p>
               <p>The third Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement forbiddeth vs <hi>to take Gods name in vaine.</hi> But Papiſtes in their raſcall <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> annotations in <hi>Act. <hi>23.</hi>

And the Pope commaundeth his followers to break their othes giuen to Princes by him excommunicate vppon paine of damnation.</p>
               <p>God commaundeth ſubiects to obey Kinges, and Children to honor Parents. The Pope commaundeth them to Rebell and take armes againſt ſuch as he excommunicateth, and willeth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be exequutioners of their Fathers, by his inquiſitors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſely iudged Heretikes.</p>
               <p>God forbiddeth murder, adultery, fornication, theft, falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing and concupiſcence. The Pope promiſeth heauen to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Princes, and to Gun-powder Traytors, permitteth common ſtewes, &amp; receiueth the hyre of Whores, commaundeth all his followers to ſpoyle ſuch as by him are moſt vniuſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, by lyes and forgeryes maintayneth his vſurped Monarchy, and determineth in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence is no ſinne in the regenerate.

               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> none but Atheiſtes eyther take to themſelues diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or giue the ſame to creatures. But the Pope <hi>c. ſatis. diſt. <hi>96.</hi>

                  <hi>Ninthly</hi> it is playne Atheiſme to deuiſe, new worſhips of God. For Chriſtians haue but one God and one worſhip of God preſcribed in his word. It is alſo atheiſme to violate Chriſtes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in his Sacraments. But Papiſts haue deuiſed diuers new formes in worſhipping of God by Maſſes prayers to ſaints, incenſing of images, leading about Aſſes, carying of palmes, and infinite ſuch like ceremonies. They haue alſo deuiſed new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and made them equal to baptiſme and the Lords Supper. Vnto bapiſme they haue added chriſme, ſalt, ſpittle, light. From Chriſtes ſupper they haue taken the Cuppe. They haue aboliſhed bread and wine. Of a Sacrament to bee receiued they haue made a ſacrifice to be heaued and offered.

The Pope claymeth to be aboue the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councell, and aboue the Church. If the whole world ſhold giue ſentence againſt the Pope, they ſay his ſentence is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before all. Him they honor as ſupreme iudge. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

For vnder the title of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the ſole and true head of the church they admit <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and bring vs foorth a monſter, not onely with two heades, but with as many heades as Popes. There wanteth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing, but ſome <hi>Hercules,</hi> to cut of theſe <hi>Hydraes</hi> heades, and to reſtore to <hi>Chriſt</hi> his right of headſhip. Further in euerye vacation they want their viſible head, which as <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſaith, <hi>giueth adauantage to Atheiſtes, and maketh them to make a mocke at Religion.</hi> They haue alſo ſome times Popes without brayne, or witte: which is as great an inconuenience, as the reſt.</p>
               <p>Finally if ſuch as teach erroneouſly of the preſence of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body &amp; blood in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament, &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> inſtitution, <hi>ruine Chriſtian Religion, and call all other myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the faith into queſtion,</hi> as <hi>Kelliſon <hi>Page.</hi> 698.</hi> reſolutelye
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:177778:70"/> and peremptorily auoucheth; then will it plainely fall out, that the Papiſtes are <hi>ruiners of Religion,</hi> and haue no aſſurance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of faith by them defended. For as I haue before touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhall elſe-where more plentifully declare, they erre moſte groſſely in their Doctrine concerning the real preſence, and haue ſhamefully miſtaken and corrupted <hi>Chriſtes</hi> inſtitution of that holy myſterie.</p>
               <p>Wee may therefore conclude firſt, that as the true profeſſors of the chriſtian faith in the church of <hi>England</hi> are moſte innocent and cleare of this ſhameleſſe imputation of atheiſme moſte wrongfully charged vpon them by this ſurueying, or rather ſurfeting Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; ſo the Papiſts our aduerſaries and the principall actors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them are much to be ſuſpected, that vnder colour of Popery, they couer a ſecret poyſon of atheiſme. Secondly if eyther our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, or any other would with indifferent eyes and vnpartial iudgement conſider eyther the articles of our faith, which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, or the deformities and abuſes of poperie which we refuſe and deteſt, diſcerning truth from the ſlaundrous imputations of ſuch wicked ſycophants as this; that then they would neither miſlike vs for our forſaking the Synagogue of Satan, nor allowe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious courſes of our rayling aduerſaries, nor long ſticke in the myrie and filthie puddle of popiſh errors, and indure his tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gouernement.</p>
               <p>ALmighty God, which haſt told vs, that Antichriſt ſhal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, and ſlayne by the breath of the mouth of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and deſtroyed with the brightneſſe of his comming, vouchſafe dayly more and more to reueale him to all the chriſtian world, and to diſcouer his trecherous and murdrous practiſes to all true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes, and to diſpell the miſtes of calumniations, lyes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geryes, which his agentes doe dayly endeuour to ſpread abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſors of truth, that ſo the truth appearing, both ſuch as are in error may be reformed, and the weake confirmed in the ſincere profeſſion of the Goſpell, &amp; the Kingdome of Antichriſt deſtroyed through our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. And let all thoſe, that wiſh the proſperity of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the conuerſion or confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> ſay alwaies <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IDICVLOVS it is, gentle Reader, for him, that entreth into the Battle, to complaine of blowes. He that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to ſtrike others muſt not thinke ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, if he be ſtriken himſelfe. And yet I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue my aduerſaryes bluſh not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that heerein they haue receiued wrong. They, I ſay, that come like wolues with open mouth to deuoure vs, &amp; raile at M. LVTHER, Maiſter CALVIN, &amp; al the church of <hi>England,</hi> as if it conſiſted of <hi>Heretikes, Schiſmatikes, looſe liuers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Atheiſtes,</hi> nay of a ſort of men worſe then <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> finde fault with me, if I tell them of their hereſies, Treaſons, Gun-powder practiſes, Idolatryes, infidelitie, perjuries, and other vilanies.</p>
            <p>Whether they, or we haue reaſon, I referre my ſelfe to indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judges, that ſhal read the Treatiſes of both the partyes. HILARY in his Book againſt CONSTANTIVS thought it no fault to ſpeake ſharply, if truely. <hi>Si falſa dicimus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ſit ſermo malidicus.</hi> That is, <hi>if we ſpeake vntruth, let our tarte ſpeache ſeeme infamous.</hi> Otherwiſe he challengeth <hi>the liberty of Apoſtles in cenſuring manifeſt faults. Si vniuerſa haec manifeſta eſſe oſtendimus</hi> ſaith he, <hi>non ſumus extra apoſtolicam libertatem, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtiam.</hi> Saint HIEROME <hi>apolog.</hi> 2. <hi>in Ruffin.</hi> thinketh it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>to barke for Chriſt, becauſe Dogges barke for their Maiſters. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes latrant pro dominis ſuis, tu non me vis latrare pro Chriſto?</hi> Beſide that, when a man is accuſed of Hereſie, hee <hi>would not haue him patient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then we neither ſhew impatiency, nor ſpeake doggedlie, but only report thoſe crimes truely, of which our aduerſaryes are moſt guilty; it is then our aduerſaries euill conſcience that pincheth, rather then our tart ſtile that byteth. To let Dogges
<pb facs="tcp:177778:71"/> baule without correcting were nothing elſe, but to encourage them in their dogged ſnarling and barking: and <hi>Biſhop Iewell</hi> of reuerend memory and others, that haue vſed this mildeneſſe haue greatly confirmed our aduerſaryes malice.</p>
            <p>This therfore vnderſtand, that it is not out of ſtomacke, but out of iudgment, that wee take this courſe of plaine dealing. <hi>Phryx plagis emendatur.</hi> The PHRYGIAN, and ſuch as are of his baſe humor, <hi>are bettred with ſtripes,</hi> rather then with gentle wordes. There diſtemper is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as THEOPHRASTVS ſaith <hi>in ſympoſ. apud Plutarchum,</hi> That is, <hi>a drunkenneſſe without wine.</hi> But it may be corrected with a ſad and tart anſwere. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neceſſity forced vs, for the repelling of their malicious ſlaunders, to ſhewe, that they are to bee charged with thoſe crimes juſtly, which they impute to innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men moſt falſely. And it may bee, if truth make them not ceaſe their barking, yet ſhame will make them barke more ſoftly.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon of our doing: which if thou be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, I hope thou wilt allow. If enimie, I hope thou canſt not juſtly condemne. And if thou beeſt experimented in theſe courſes, thou canſt not chuſe but acknowledge the ſame to bee both profitable, honeſt, and neceſſary. Profitable to repreſſe the malice of ſuch Curres, as continually barke againſt truth: honeſt for the defence of the pious memorie of the innocent: and neceſſary for the ending of theſe brablements. If the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries giue vs no occation to lay open theit faultes, we ſhall be content to burye them in ſilence. If they perſiſt in rayling and reuiling at honeſt men, they muſt haue patience to heare our free anſwer. Againſt Popes, Cardinals, Monkes, Fryers, Maſſe-prieſtes and their ſeditious Salt-peter followers, wee cannot want either wordes, or matter. This is that which I thought good to aduertiſe thee, and which I hope will ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all, if they bee indifferent. If not indifferent, they haue no reaſon to take vppon them, to bee our judges, nor we to vnder-goe their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor you to miſlike our ſtile, as too ſharp and vnfitting.</p>
